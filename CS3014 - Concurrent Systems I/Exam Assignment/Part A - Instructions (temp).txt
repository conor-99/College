This is part A of a two part assignment which will take the place of the annual exam for CSU33014.

Please download the file csu33014-annual-partA.zip, and unzip:

unzip csu33014-annual-partA.zip

The zip file contains four files: csu33014-annual-partA-code.c, csu33014-annual-partA-code.h, csu33014-annual-partA-main.c, and Makefile.

Of these three files, you should modify only csu33014-annual-partA-code.c. Please follow the instructions in the file csu33014-annual-partA-code.c, and add vectorized code for each of the six empty vectorized routines.

To compile your code type:

make all

To test your code type:

make test

When you type make test you will get a number for each test, where the number is some measure of the difference between the output of the original non-vectorized code and the vectorized version. Before you write your vectorized code, the differences will be large. Your vectorized code should produce outputs where the difference is either zero in most cases, or very small in cases where you change the order of floating point evaluation.

You should submit your solution using Blackboard. Please upload all four files, but please make changes only to the file csu33014-annual-partA-code.c. Please also upload a fifth file containing a declaration that the work is entirely your own and you have not collaborated with anyone. A pdf template for this declaration is among the assignment files.
