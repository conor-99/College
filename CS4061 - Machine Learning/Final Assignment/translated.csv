"This Game reached officially Gold-Status, for me it reached Platinum-Status.  A 100000/10 it is far beyond the maximum points  𝔼ℕ𝔾𝕃𝕀𝕊ℍ ℝ𝕖𝕧𝕚𝕖𝕨 The story about Kuro's descendant Ku is lovingly staged - even with dramatic spatial story sequences: On a trip with Ori, the orphan owl's patched plumage fails in the thunderstorm, so that both end up in different places in the forest and the likeable hero turns out to be again embarks on an open exploration journey. The story takes a back seat most of the time, but now conversations with all sorts of mystical creatures like the resourceful Moki or a wise giant toad make a nice change. The focus here is on bouncing, action and exploration. The decision for direct combat control is actually a blessing for the open platformer in the Metroid style: above the opponent you slit down with the ghost blade, knock a spiny reptile with a hammer out of the tank or shoot a three-part arrow with the bow a cocky plant. Wipe-wipe-wipe - and it goes on - while you double jump and dash through the projectile chaos. Very elegant! More and more acrobatic tricks like a grappling hook or feather paraglider are released, in which the ""turning back"" of opponents and projectiles is still one of the coolest examples. At the push of a button, an explosive bullet hisses back to the sender - or you use the ability to hurl the entire flame beetle into a row of spikes. Have a good flight! A new highlight is the digging ability, thanks to which Ori slips through hidden tunnels, discovers new places and catapults itself on heights when exiting the earth with an extra thrust. A nice homage to the age-old snake principle, because you can also shoot through aggressive sandworms to disassemble them properly. It gets similarly fluid and tricky under water: there, the blue-glowing all-rounder repeatedly attracts intrusive torpedo beasts to porous walls. It is also nice that different techniques do not degenerate into gimmicks, but have to be extensively linked in the huge world. The variety of mechanics and challenges is enormous! There are insidious deposits, online challenges with leaderboards and friend-spirits, shy algae switches, gliding with the owl Ku, exciting boss fights and much, much more. Against the first armored Obermotz beetle, rhythmic dodging and striking is enough. In order not to end up under the claws of a glowing giant spider, more acrobatics is required with the lasso.  Wonderful Game 𝔾𝔼ℝ𝕄𝔸ℕ ℝ𝕖𝕧𝕚𝕖𝕨 Die Geschichte um Kuros Nachfahre Ku ist herzallerliebst in Szene gesetzt – sogar mit dramatischen räumlichen Story-Sequenzen: Auf einem Ausflug mit Ori versagt das geflickte Federkleid der Waisen-Eule im Gewitter, so dass beide an unterschiedlichen Orten im Wald landen und der sympathische Held sich erneut auf eine offene Erkundungs-Reise begibt. Die Geschichte tritt zwar die meiste Zeit über in den Hintergrund, trotzdem bilden die Gepräche mit allerlei mystischen Kreaturen wie den findigen Moki oder einer weisen Riesenkröte einen schönen Rahmen. Im Zentrum stehen hier das Hüpfen, Action und die Erkundung. Die Entscheidung für eine direkte Kampfsteuerung ist tatsächlich ein Segen für den offenen Plattformer im Metroid-Stil: Noch über dem Gegner schlitzt man mit der Geisterklinge nach unten, kloppt ein stachliges Kriechtier schwungvoll mit dem Hammer aus dem Panzer oder schießt mit dem Bogen eine dreigeteilten Pfeil zu einer übermütig schnappenden Pflanze. Wisch-wusch-wisch – und weiter geht‘s – während man per Doppelsprung und Dash durch das Projektil-Chaos turnt. Sehr elegant! Nach und nach werden weitere akrobatische Tricks wie ein Greifhaken oder Feder-Gleitschirm freigeschaltet, bei denen das „Umkehren“ von Gegnern und Projektilen nach wie vor zu den coolsten Exemplaren gehört. Auf Knopfdruck zischt ein explosives Geschoss zurück zum Absender – oder man schleudert mit Hilfe der Fähigkeit gleich den kompletten Flammenkäfer in eine Reihe Stacheln. Guten Flug! Ein neues Highlight ist die Grabfähigkeit, dank der Ori durch versteckte Tunnels schlüpft, neue Orte entdeckt und sich beim Austritt aus der Erde mit Extraschub auf Anhöhen katapultiert. Eine schöne Hommage ans uralte Snake-Prinzip, da man auch quer durch angriffslustige Sandwürmer schießt, um sie fachgerecht zu zerlegen. Ähnlich flüssig und knifflig wird es unter Wasser: Dort lockt das blau glühende Multitalent immer wieder aufdringliche Torpedo-Biester zu porösen Wänden. Schön auch, dass unterschiedliche Techniken nicht zum Gimmick verkommen, sondern in der riesigen Welt ausführlich miteinander verknüpft werden müssen. Der Abwechslungsreichtum der Mechaniken und Herausforderungen ist enorm! Es gibt Schleich-Einlagen, Online-Herausforderungen mit Bestenlisten und Freundes-Geistern, scheue lebendige Algen-Schalter, das Gleiten durch Aufwinde mit Eule Ku, spannende Bosskämpfe und vieles, vieles mehr. Gegen den ersten gepanzerten Obermotz-Käfer reicht noch rhythmisches Ausweichen und Zuschlagen. Um später nicht unter den Klauen einer glühenden Riesenspinne zu landen, ist schon mehr Akrobatik am Lasso gefragt. Wundervolles Spiel Powered by HoI 4 Valve Curatorgroup",True,False
"Game recommendation: / / In a world where boundless evil reigns, we are assigned the role of a fallen warrior named Talion, who loses his son and wife before his very eyes, and then he is sacrificed for a ritual ceremony in order to invoke the spirit of the Light Lord. Celebrimbor aka the Light Lord takes over Talion and they become one. Later, Talion learns that death has rejected him and he is stuck between the world of Light and the world of Darkness, which means that he cannot find peace and reunite with his family in the afterlife. Therefore, in order to remove the curse, Talion, together with the Light Lord, will have to find the Black Hand of Sauron and destroy him. If you mix such famous games as Batman and Assassins creed, then we got Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, only with its own exciting world and many interesting moments. What I liked most about the game was the variety of enemies and their character. But only? Of course not, but I assure you, having spent more than 20 hours in the game, I met only a couple of monotonous opponents, which is good news. I don't know why many people write that the game presents players with a tedious process of passing ... I went through Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor with great interest, although I am not a fan of films and books of this universe. After completing the introductory quest, a small open world awaits us, which is divided into two maps: In addition to 20 main quests, there are quite a few side quests in the game that are related to the rescue of outcasts; completing various challenges and collecting collectibles scattered around the world. Thanks to the Towers - Forges, which we visit during the game, it will be possible to use them in the future as fast travel around the world, as well as use them to speed up the events of the game. It's up to you which path to go, you can deliver deadly blows from the shadows, or go ahead against large clusters of opponents, but when the enemy raises the alarm, the battles become hotter. During the battles, we can use various decoys that give us advantages. For example, when we drop the bait, then in a couple of seconds a flock of hungry Karagor will come running to it or a huge Graug will come (depending on the bait), and it is also possible to knock down nests with Morgai flies, after which the enemies will scatter in different directions. It is worth noting that the game has quite a few epic-beautiful finishing moves (Execution). In order to carry out the execution, you need to reach a certain amount of combos, after which our hero will enter the rage mode, and the limbs of the enemies in the meantime will scatter in different directions. Also in the game, for completing tasks and killing enemies, we gain experience, which in the future allows us to acquire new abilities and skills, which are divided into two categories: Another interesting and important aspect of the game that is worth noting. Enemies in the game are divided into Leaders, Captains and ordinary warriors. In order to reveal the identity of any captain, it is enough to interrogate any private, and in order to reveal the identity of the leader, in this case it is necessary to press the captain against the wall. Also, Leaders and Captains have their own weaknesses and advantages, which we can learn from certain warriors or find information randomly in fortresses. Each leader has his own bodyguards - these are the same captains. If you killed the leader, then one of the bodyguards will take his place. It is also worth noting that if you fell in battle at the hands of an ordinary private, then in this case he will become the captain. Thus, he can be elevated to the Leader. There is also a reverse turn. Over time, we will get an interesting Brand ability. With the help of this skill, you can recruit absolutely any opponent and make him our supporter. For example, if you brand the Leader, then he and all his bodyguards will go over to our side, and in the future he can be set on another Leader. This way we can gather our own army and issue orders to them. You can also brand the captain and introduce him as a bodyguard to one of the Chiefs. Mutants can also be branded and used both in battles and simply in movement. In general, this is a completely interesting game in its theme, which is worth plunging into and clearing the lands of Mordor from evil. ",True,False

本文转载自知乎专栏22383924 作者：破天之雷 8月31日，《巫师3：狂猎》年度版Steam国区上架，以158元的白菜价贩卖着内含16个内容DLC的游戏本体以及《石之心》《血与酒》两大资料片的业界良心。 它的游戏介绍是“2015年获奖最多的游戏”。但在玩家看来应该再加一条——“近年来最有良心的游戏”。 让我们把日历翻回到2016年3月16日，这一天是全球游戏行业最重要的年度游戏盛会——GDC游戏开发者大会。这一天，评委们将公布2015年的年度最佳游戏是谁。 《巫 师3》、《MGSV：幻痛》、《血源诅咒》、《辐射4》、《火箭联盟》在GDC2016先后获得了提名。而这些候选者中，除了《火箭联盟》这个独立游戏 外，其他个个都来头不小：有游戏行业的教父级制作人小岛秀夫的IGN满分神作；有SCE鼎力支持，继承《魂》系列之精华的PS4年度黑马；也有把细节做到 极致，E3大出风头的B社核弹大作……玩家们虽然早就已经开始为年度游戏花落谁家争论不休。但是在如此多的强敌面前，真没多少玩家敢肯定《巫师3》能脱颖 而出——毕竟当年《巫师2》遭遇B社的《上古卷轴5》，痛失桂冠的历史还历历在目。 在令人激动的漫长等待之后，年度大奖最终落在了CD Projekt RED的《巫师3》头上，以完美的戏剧性回馈了观看这场大戏的玩家们。 一、“波兰蠢驴”的故事 CDPROJEKT创始人MarcinIwinski在一次采访中，第一次知道了中国玩家称呼他们为“波兰蠢驴”。而帅气的Marcin先生，他的回答大意是这样的：他喜欢这个称呼。 这个答案可谓是意料之外，情理之中。 Marcin领导下的CD Projekt RED大概做了如下的蠢事： 当其他游戏同行为了赚钱丧心病狂地堆DLC海来骗钱的时候。CD Projekt RED一口气做了8个高质量的DLC然后免费发放给所有的玩家； 当其他游戏同行用相同的引擎资料编辑器，做够10小时的新内容就敢拿出来当续作卖钱的时候，CD Projekt RED把长度达20小时的新内容当成DLC卖； 《巫师3》的游戏盒子里，送了一堆地图，原声集，原画人设图等东西。对于实体游戏的销售渠道来说，经过平台商，销售商，仓库成本层层分成，一个定价60美元的 游戏实际上也就只剩10多美元的纯利了，但是Marcin觉得只有光盘还不够，宁愿再花钱添置更丰厚的礼物给玩家，为此继续降低利润率也在所不惜。当然 了，接下来的巫师3仅有的两个都可以当续作卖的DLC，甚至直接给购买的玩家赠送一整套昆特牌。至于主机同捆版，赠品就更丰厚了。 当 其他游戏不惜代价也要加入D加密（Denuvo）作为DRM防盗版的时候，CD Projekt RED把游戏轻松拿到自家GOG网站上面卖钱。而更让同行觉得不可理喻的事情是，GOG上面卖的“正版游戏”没有做任何DRM保护措施。这个波兰人的 GOG平台甚至是让游戏行业一大帮同行都不敢把自己的游戏拿上去卖。因为这些同行知道，他们的游戏一旦拿到上面卖，就再也别想堵住盗版了。 这个难以置信的故事，真真实实的发生在了今天，发生在一家注册资产已经超过1亿美元级别的大公司。这些离经叛道的行为，只有一个词来形容：疯狂！ Marcin不是不知道他这么做的后果。但是他有一个简单的信念：只要做出了有价值的游戏，玩家就会买单。 CDProjekt RED有非常多的机会赚更多的钱，但是他把持得住。在8000万美元的开发成本下，这家大公司为了他们的理想，居然一点都不打算退缩。甚至连玩家都看不下 去了，玩家们都说这个游戏要在昆特牌上做微交易实在是太简单了。这年头连暴雪都开窍做卡牌游戏“FREE TO PAY”然后通过卖卡大赚特赚。但是波兰人就是死脑筋，打死不做这些可能有损他们“蠢驴信条”的事情。 这些完全违反了市场经济规律的行为，让这些波兰人得到了一个明贬暗褒的称号——波兰蠢驴。从此，游戏行业在评价游戏开发商的良心的时候，有了一个难以超越的标杆。 二、波兰人的成功资本 波兰人是幸运的。他用着8000万美元玩一个叫“良心”的游戏，居然还打赢了这一回合。 波兰人在自己完全不做DRM保护的时候，居然在上市一年以后吗，就全平台正版销量达到了1000万这个级别。当然，对波兰人来说，他这个销售额，都可以说成是游戏的“众筹”额度了。 为什么，《巫师3》在完全不做DRM保护的情况下，居然也能大卖特卖然后获得成功？要知道，不做DRM保护，等于是自己默认玩家复制不违法啊。这简直是违反资本主义规律，违反经济学所谓“理性经济人”假设的啊！ 只是，《巫师3》是幸运的。幸运女神垂青了这个理想者。 天时： 《巫师3》上线的时间，正好是游戏主机平台刚刚换代。新平台尚未出现AAA RPG庞大市场的“剑与魔法”题材大作的空档期。而围绕上个世代优化的《上古卷轴5》已经显得落后了。《巫师3》也只需要达到这个世代沙盒AAA的标准水 平，再比《龙腾世纪3：审判》《中土世纪：暗影魔多》有游戏体验的差异化，就有成功的的潜质。另外，这一代游戏机和PC都已经统一X86架构，开发便捷大 幅提升，移植成本也大幅降低。最后，这一代游戏机（尤其是PS4）销售速度甚至比上个世代都快，也是加分项。 地利：CD PROJECT有自己的销售平台GOG。更早了说，这家公司根本之前就是搞游戏盗版销售起家的，因此他们也对游戏玩家购买游戏的行为理解的非常透彻。他们 一开始就是经验丰富的游戏销售公司，而同期尽管他不限制拷贝数量。但是PS4/XBOXONE距离破解还差个十万八千里，而STEAM平台上更是只有正版 玩家。在销售自己的游戏上，CD Projekt RED在游戏光碟里送出了同期游戏舍不得做的大礼包，而在销售DLC上甚至直接送昆特牌实体卡以促销。 人和： 连续成功开发了两代《巫师》的300人开发团队实力毋庸置疑，而且常胜之军，士气旺盛到顶峰。整个团队在《巫师2：国王刺客》送给奥巴马当礼物之后，已经 成为波兰人心目中的骄傲。另一面，波兰这个位置其实也是得天独厚：东欧盛产美女，波兰人的审美眼光也自然比欧美传统游戏开发商来得要强那么一点点。因此， 我们在游戏里看到的希里、叶奈法、特丽斯等美女也都是个个看着就养眼，完全打破欧美游戏不敢做美女的恶劣传统。 除了这些可遇不可求的机遇之外，《巫师3》在另外一个维度上也抽中了大奖。 《巫师3》在游戏玩法上，最伟大的决定在于其内置了一个好玩的卡牌游戏——昆特牌。“先来一把昆特牌”成了这个RPG的点睛之笔，一下子就把游戏世界盘活了，把玩家的游戏情绪持续不断调动起来。 在 第八世代这个以沙盒为王的世代里，开发商在开发沙盒游戏时遇到了新的困难。沙盒除了要各种细节到位之外，还要把各种任务流程做得很有趣，很有创意才行。但 无论开发商怎么把沙盒里的任务流程做得再有趣，总有一大批玩家觉得“无聊”。因为沙盒游戏太像一段人生了。而越像一段真实人生，这个流程就越无聊。 为 了解决沙盒中的产生的无聊病，游戏开发商绞尽脑汁。他们发现，解决高拟真沙盒游戏的无聊病最简单的方式，就是在游戏里加入小游戏补充玩家的娱乐需求。《如 龙》系列给出的答案是把世嘉自己曾经的街机游戏厅，日本传统的各种娱乐活动，麻将将棋四驱车等加入游戏；《GTA5》则是把他们能想到能做到的全部可能性 都做进去。而《巫师3》灵光一现，在厕所拉屎时间想出来的昆特牌，则成了风靡整个巫师世界的迷你游戏。 因为昆特牌和它那些笑梗的知名度，《巫师3》得以锦上添花，CD Projekt RED甚至已经将昆特牌这个游戏独立出来，打造为又一个成功品牌。 三、其他公司难以复制的成功模式 《巫师3》的成功，实际上是开发团队CD Projekt RED单枪匹马挑战了后互联网时代一种新型经济模式的成功。这个互联网时代的新经济，互联网教父“凯文凯利”称之为“粉丝经济”。 粉 丝经济是新互联网时代的钥匙，其核心思想是聚集1000个有价值的粉丝起步，然后靠吸引粉丝付费实现盈利。粉丝经济理论在互联网时代得到了实践，一大堆由 个人用户兴起的“自媒体”诞生了。自媒体围绕着BBS，博客，微博，微信公众号，视频站，直播站，知乎等载体，不断产出优质的内容，吸引更多的粉丝关注订 阅。粉丝觉得你的内容靠谱喜欢，就会实际行动支持作者。而最直接的行为，便是“打赏”。这个功能的创造，实际是上解决了粉丝无法直接支持自己喜欢的内容创 作者的刚需，以至于被视为烧钱的“直播站”，虎牙早期甚至靠粉丝对主播“打赏”的抽成居然做到了盈利。（后期斗鱼崛起陷入直播乱战之后就另说了） 然 而，与“自媒体”行业不同，游戏行业发展到今天。大作已经是需要几百人团队外加上千人的外包结果才能完成的了。粉丝打赏养活一个小作坊团队没有问题，但是 如何支持千万级美元的投资额度确是一件根本没有底子的事情。《星际公民》众筹超过了1亿美元是不错，但是从《无人深空》的最终结果来看，很难说《星际公 民》会不会因暴死而引发玩家对游戏众筹的信任的雪崩效应。但是要记住，《星际公民》有且仅有这一个案例。剩下的世嘉知名制作人铃木裕在E3公开乞讨，也才 拿到600多万美元的开发资金。 游 戏行业发展这么多年，被证明行之有效的收费方式有以下几种：买断+DLC付费制；试玩+章节关卡付费制；月卡/点卡制；道具收费制；氪金制；投币制。不管 是从国内还是国外的历史来看，指望玩家主动掏钱养活开发商，是一件根本不可能的事情。因为相当一定比例的玩家并不想为他们使用的游戏软件付费，游戏厂商也 只能使用各种加密制度和各种硬件手段以及法律手段以阻止玩家使用盗版。虽然游戏一再被破解，但是开发商总是想办法尽力避免自己的下一款游戏被破解，或者至 少让游戏被破解的时间延长一点。 而CDProjekt RED的行为，除了理想主义不做第二个解释。这家开发公司，就像当年LINUX程序开源；卡马克想要全世界的玩家都可以自由分享，自由开发游戏一样。 GOG销售平台直接挑明了一件事：你如果没有钱或者不想付费，我们并不禁止你玩我们的游戏。我们在GOG平台上所出售的全部游戏，都是允许玩家自由拷贝 的。Marcin只要得到那些愿意付费的玩家支持，就够了。 从这个意义上来说，CD Projekt RED在传统的游戏盈利方式之外，又创造了一个新的盈利模式：FREETO PAY。这个不是传统“免费”游戏的“PAY TO WIN”，而是真正意义上的“自由付费”。如果买断制相比“免费”游戏已经是良心的话，那CD Projekt RED的“FREE TO PAY”则是比买断制更加“良心”的所在。这种良心让Marcin轻描淡写“我觉得够赚够了”为结语。 CDPROJEKT 在2015年全年本可以赚2亿美元，但他们只赚了1亿。但这个“波兰蠢驴”的行为为他们赚取了1亿美元也买不到的东西——这个世界千万的忠实玩家对CD Projekt RED的“良心”口碑。举例来说，我自己的游戏群里，一名从来不买正版的“铁杆”盗版玩家，他为《巫师3》第一次付了全款，还说如果有续集，正版接着买。 ——这可是《GTA5》都没能做到的。而《巫师3》却做到了，他感动了盗版玩家。 或许，CD Projekt才是最聪明最有远见的开发商。因为他们赢得了未来。《巫师3》这些完全违反当今游戏业行规的行为，为CD PROJEKT赚到了大量的死忠级粉丝，而这已经为他们未来新开发的游戏铺平了道路。作为一个领教过《巫师》良心的玩家，对于接下来的《昆特牌》、《赛博朋克》是不是已经有了先入为主的信赖？CD Projekt作为一个大公司，难得保持了小公司的机敏和勇气，敢于把钱存到未来慢慢提取，而不是像同行那样急于变现，然后不管这些行为对口碑造成的长期 伤害。CD Projekt既不担心游戏盗版造成的损失，也不担心下一作是不是有人喜欢，它可以不受任何干扰地把自己的游戏做好然后发布出来。它甚至在未来都不需要多 夸张的广告宣传预算，以现在的口碑和名望，粉丝都愿意为这样的良心公司买单。 这或许是游戏公司最为理想最极致的盈利模式，只是其他游戏公司早已无法复制。 评论精选： 这是新的营销模式的胜利。 旧的观点是：游戏是商品，盗版是盗窃，玩家们都是贪婪的穷鬼，又想要东西又不想付钱，商品如果不锁在柜子里，就会被贪婪的玩家偷走。 这种观点应该说也没错，毕竟以前的玩家确实是这样。想想当年国产单机好多公司不都死在盗版上了么？ 可是时代在进步，人的收入和素质都在提高，人的观念也在改变。 以前可能玩一个正版游戏，需要省吃俭用一个月（我还记得当时我买了个光盘38，那时候每周才2-3块钱的零花钱），现在随便什么东西消费个几百块根本不是问题。吃顿饭都2、300。 所以以前你让我花50块买正版，除非是真爱，不然不可能。 现在如果一个游戏真的很不错（但我不一定喜欢玩），我要花300去买我也不会犹豫。 想想粉丝追星花多少钱？ 想想现在各种坑钱网游手游要花多少钱才能不成为陪练？ 比起被垃圾游戏折磨或者没有好游戏玩的空虚，几百块真不贵。 当你被各种高品质游戏惯坏了，再也玩不下那些垃圾游戏时，你自然会愿意支持正版。 现在这种新的粉丝模式营销更好，典型做的好的就是暴雪，新出一个游戏，大家还没玩呢，关注度，新闻量就都上去了，各种粉黑大战就吵起来了。新游戏不管好不好先大卖一波，然后一堆人评论：暴雪药丸。 这就是粉丝的力量，用得好的话，会比以前的经营方式好得多，游戏公司不需要千方百计的防备玩家，只要做好自己的本职工作就行了。 波兰蠢驴其实不蠢，他们只是选择了做自己最擅长的事情。,True,False

"WELL, IT'S TIME FOR AN HONEST AND INCURRIBLE REVIEW OF GTA V PROS: 1. GRAPHICS THE GAME WAS RELEASED IN 2013, and then there were no games with such amazing graphics, every aspect was worked out to the smallest detail, it is clear that the developers meticulously made the game and worked on it ... Although the graphics were not finalized in the car and on the side mirrors. The coolest thing in this game is to drive or fly around the city at night, the graphics are amazing Rating: 9/10 2.PHYSICS The fifth part of the GRAND THEFT AUTO V series is famous for its physics. For example: when a character enters the water, clothes become wet, to the very place, where he stands. If the character runs a lot in the sun, then he sweats, The physics of cars is one of the most realistic in the series. The slippers do not completely adhere to the foot, such little things are just 100% worked out. I also liked the physics of burning cars, explosions, and charring after an explosion RATING: 10/10 3. Budget It can be seen that tons of money were spent on the game (250 million dollars). became the most expensive in the history of games. Having overtaken on the budget even films, such as Avatar or the Black Knight or Titanic. It is evident that the game was not made from under the stick.

Plot The plot, the plot came to me personally, the course of the main characters is interestingly shown. A plot with a staged murder, I've never seen anything like it in games. I also forgot to note that the plot revolves around THREE PROTAGONISTS. The characters themselves are of different character and different incomes, but they are all united by one hobby, the ROBBERY. Coolest heist, latest in the game RATING: 10/10 5. STEREOTYPES Rockstar Games has always shown how to taunt FOSHYZD, SEXISTS, ROSYZD, etc. In the GTA series, politicians have always been mocked (Statue of Liberty is a parody of Hillary Clinton and her election policy, she also holds a glass of hot coffee in her hand, I think many will understand what this is connected with) In the GTA series, they have always mocked racists, the problem of racism is shown in the game, personifying the culture of the ghetto, where drugs are sold, robbed, this was all always made fun of , also with sexism In the GTA series, there have always been prostitutes and strip clubs that protested modern feminism. AND THIS IS FUCKING! 6. DISPUTES AND TRIALS The game has been heavily criticized for scenes of torture and sexism. In the mission, where Trevor interrogates the hostage, the player has the opportunity to use any instrument of torture. Reporters described the torture scene as a political commentary, with some believing the mission to be tactless. A similar opinion was expressed by politicians and charities against torture. The game was considered a topic of discussion about sexism. Caroline Petit, a GameSpot columnist, described the game as a dislike for women. The opinion of the journalist caused over 20 thousand negative comments, and many observers supported her comment. TV star Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan have sued Rockstar, claiming that the characters in the game were modeled after them. Later, their claims were dismissed. Australian retailer Target has pulled the game out of sales following multiple complaints about violence against women shown in the game. The game was sued several times and wanted to be banned in some countries. But GTA V is a great game, and you can't ban it 7. SALES GTA V is not only the most expensive game in terms of development and marketing costs in history, but also one of the most popular - for 2018, its cumulative sales on all platforms exceed 95 million copies, second only to sales of Tetris and Minecraft. In its latest quarterly report for 2020, Take-Two Interactive revealed that the game has sold 130 million copies over its entire history. GTA 5 still attracts players from all over the world, and sales are only increasing. Now MINUSES More precisely, the plot of GTA V has no drawbacks, and GTA ONLINE CONS: 1. Donate Yes, donate, when GTA was released online, I thought it would cost without donation ,but no. Without donation, it is very difficult to break into an online game from the very beginning. Weapons are expensive, bullets are quickly spent, plus you need only top-class housing for organizing robberies, offices, garages, bunkers, hangars, bases to farm shekels Of course, there is an in-game donate, but in - firstly, it is very expensive, and secondly, there is a limited amount of money that can be bought at a time. The best, I think these are groups for pumping VKontakte, they are very full, and they do everything very cheaply, let's say you can order 100 for 200 rubles millions of game currency, of course there are many groups that cheat, but there are also many honest groups from famous youtubers in GTA V. When you order a pumping, there is a chance of a ban, so act at your own peril and risk. Well, this was the most honest review on the game GTA V. We looked at the game from different angles, and saw both the pros and cons. Rate this review if you see fit! ",True,False
"[It takes 62 hours to ending] Did you ever feel disappointed to progress through the story while enjoying the game like this? It was a game that I think about again. I have been playing all kinds of games so far and watching the ending, huh? Already done? If I only had this feeling, this game made me think that it's ah, it's over. But, if it's unfortunate, the whole story is predictable, and if this guy is the killer, seeing that he is the killer. It made me feel that I came. I recommend this game. The price is full price and the money will not be a waste. Unlike other games where you only get money and eat money, this game is really fun, has a taste of decorating, and has 50 hours of story. It was weird. This is a game where you can multiplayer with your friends by making what you want to make, rather than having nothing to do after seeing the ending or going to hell to eat items. I highly recommend it. If you say it is too expensive, you can play once at a discount. Try it and if you like it, please buy it. ",True,False

"The best and last part of the series at the moment, in which everything is fine. A variety of locations, a branched plot in which the choice and actions of the player really influence the further development of events in the world both globally and locally for even small towns or villages. It is worth noting the elaboration of additional tasks, the number and quality of which is higher than a good half of the main plots of modern AAA projects. The game is very detailed in everything from a huge amount of equipment, different alchemical components, and ending with the same tasks, where even small additional quests have several completely different endings. Very important is the emergence of many new monsters, which were not in previous parts. The game also has a great atmosphere, which is achieved by the same sophistication of the environment and characters, which, combined with excellent graphics and sound, bring great pleasure from being in this world, and passing at maximum difficulty enhances these positive emotions and increases the number of gameplay moments. which need to be used in the passage. We should not forget about the game of Gwint, which the players liked so much that the developers created a separate game, which, incidentally, was recently released in Steam.

"Aim lab is a free version of a training program (I wouldn't call it a game) to improve the accuracy of the mouse, called Aim. It helps you get better at other games without cheating, it's all a matter of practice and perfectly legitimate. Personally, with this experience, I have improved my skills enormously within a few hours, but in a special mode, I cannot judge whether this will also have a positive effect on other games, but it certainly doesn't hurt. Aim lab is currently still in the Early Access phase, i.e. still in development, currently around 40% of the progress seems to have been achieved, so a lot more is planned, but let me say one thing, it already has an enormous number of different exercises that you can train with are really quite a lot, from exercises to improve the reaction to ""patching"", 360 degree shots or even those where you have to shoot for your ear, so it is already varied . There are also worldwide ranking lists or you can compare your points with your friends in a mode, the program also tells you where you did well and what you can still improve, it gives you tips. Then there is also workshop content where you can download special exercises, such as those for Counter Strike or Apex Legends. The program can be taken seriously, if you train something with it every day, you are guaranteed to quickly get better at aiming, or as a little pastime that can be absolutely addicting if you want to beat your own score or that of a friend. Since it's free, and who knows if it will stay that way, nothing stands in the way of giving it a try? One of my favorite modes is e.g. Gridshot, would you like to try to beat my current record? Come on then, what are you waiting for?

"Layers of Fear is a psychedelic horror story where you play as a deranged artist who can't quite seem to remember the layout of his house. +excellent graphics +excellent art direction +excellent sound direction +excellent atmosphere - very short - shock value wears off in the 2nd half Layers of Fear starts off with a slow self narrated doublespeak exclaiming a hopelessness in his situation, with only one way to bring it all back...'Finish it' he mutters to himself as you hear rain and lightning droning in the background. Keys clanking onto metal, you hear sounds of a door opening, you are brought to attention from the pitch black screen to a scene of a mansion. You are now in control of the main character, whom you know absolutely nothing about until you explore the depths of the mansion, rummaging through every single drawer and cabinet looking for notes scattered about to give you an inkling of an idea of who the main character may be. Early on you find out that the character is an artist, or at least was an artist sometime in the 19th century. You have the freedom to explore the mansion and it's room which are heavily Victorian in nature. A creepy piano piece plays in the background, that perfectly captures the mood of the set piece. You're alone in a giant mansion during a thunderstorm, the place feels eerily perfect, not a speck of dust can be found. You come across an easel covered by cloth. As you slowly reveal the unfinished painting, the room subtly changes. A message is sprawled on the exit that wasn't there before, 'GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME'. You go through the door, and suddenly the mansion has transformed itself. A mist of fog rises from the floor, doors lock behind you never to reopen again. The ambient tones of the soundtrack slowly haunting you as you hesitantly move forward through the rooms. Layers of Fear introduction perfectly encapsulates a mysteriousness that had me paralyzed. Enraptured by the setting and the fear of what was to come next, it all felt vividly real. Especially with how beautiful the set pieces were room to room. On ultra settings, it's very easy to marvel at your surroundings with it's soft shadows reflecting off the dim lighted halls throughout. It's as pretty as a picture, as if it were carefully sculpted by the artist himself. The artist seems to have an obsession with perfection as when you listen to an auditory flashback of when he finds his muse, his proposal comes off eerily strange in retrospect. He wanted to put his name on the most beautiful woman in the world, just like the rest of his paintings . His object of affection was beauty at it's core, but what happens when the beauty fades? As you find out, one way or another the beauty has faded from his life. And once it does, so does his inspiration for painting. He hits a giant roadblock which is expressed visually within the game. You the player, has to help the painter find just the right items to help him finish his masterpiece. But the house isn't what it once seemed, closed off walls will appear where they were once open hallways. You will go in circles and circles while the game will openly remind you through scrawled writings on the wall. The artist's inner narrative uses his house's walls as the canvas, giving you insight as to how he feels on his deranged journey to reclaiming his lost inspiration. They seem like ramblings of a madman at first but subtly aid you to progress in the game. The mansion's are like the inner frameworks of his mind, cluttered and confusing. Neverending, yet constantly closing the paths behind you. What was once a simple mansion is now an endless mind palace that transforms at his whims, with his deepest fears manifesting , clouding the golden years where he was once hailed as a genius. The mansion from Layers of Fears strikingly resembles a similar theme from a book called House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski. In the novel, the house initially has larger internal measurements than external. Over time, the interior of the house seems to slowly expand until a hallway appears that should lead outside to where the yard is but does not. The interesting aspect is that the book also has an unusual page layout and style, making it visually surrealist in it's own way. Layers of Fears feels like it's takes this surrealist form one step further and perfects the execution using it's strong visual tricks and audial cues. Walls will shift, hallways will reverse, invert, making each room feel slightly familiar yet alien to both the player and the painter. Misdirection is key here, something Layers of Fears pulls of meticulously. The game will consistently find new ways to surprise you visually with it's metamorphic atmosphere, and this is only accomplished by the player being a witness to the painter's madness. This is the majority of what you'll be doing all game, exploring dark dreary rooms for notes and items that will help you on your quest to finish a painting. Although it would be categorized as a exploration game, it feels more like an on rails horror set. Once you're finished with a room, you can never go back making you feel like a puppet being dragged from A to B with very little to interact with except a couple drawers or shelves to find notes about past events in no real chronological order. It's mainly up to the player to decide how badly he wants to find out what's really happening in the game by opening 100s of drawers in hopes of finding more notes. You never truly feel like a player in the game interacting with the world, more like another set piece that the artist has created for you to be a witness into his madness. It's when the game does take complete control away from you, does it feel truly unique. Helpless to the panorama of horrors slowly settling closer and closer, claustrophobia settling in to the point helplessness. Your control is truly gone, you are no longer a player but a set piece just as much the painter is and it feels wonderfully surreal. The second and final act of the game delves heavily into psychedelic hallucinatory levels, where set pieces transform before you into sublimely grotesque imaginations of the painter. The problem is that the shock value of the similar jump scares have worn off at this point, and that I have absolutely nothing to fear. The first time I encounter a monster roaming the hallways, I'm terrified by the games brilliant usage of the lighting system. But you soon quickly realize that there's nothing to be done about them. The hallways are always narrow and small and the doors lock behind you so you have no choice but to either wait and see or just walk towards them and brave the brunt of their psychological attack. Once you realize that it almost feels like your 'death' is a plot progressor. This removes probably the most vital 'layer of fear' within the game. Once the element of fear is taken away, and replaced with plot progress you're no longer traumatized by their appearance but considering a quick death to move on. While you continue to march forward to find the final piece of puzzle to put the story all together, the ambiguous and surrealist nature never quite grants you that clear resolution rather leaving it up to the player's interpretation by how many notes he found throughout the short three hour game. Overall Layers of Fear is a technical marvel that is both hauntingly beautiful and surreptitiously ambiguous in nature. While the ambiguity drives the narrative forward through the character's interpretation of the artist's evocative imaginings of his mansion, the game slowly loses it's pulse of mysteriousness through the over use of jump scare tropes and identical monster encounters but never it's beauty. I recommend Layers of Fear to players who want an exploration based game who don't mind letting their imagination run wild and want to enjoy a fresh surrealist take on the genre.",True,False

You simply can't go wrong with this. First minute in and I'm absolutely captivated by the cutesy and vibrant aesthetic that the game offers. In another few moments, saw myself completely engrossed, losing track of time whilst being exposed to some underrated melodies and tracks that profusely appeal to the masses of the weaboo popculture, such as of course, myself. :3 Muse Dash consists of 3 lovely playable characters with unlockable costumes that are most meticulously fashioned, each with distinctive in-game animations and quirks.   40 tracks are in the base game with an optional addition of 13 music packs that has 6 songs/each pack. Upon the purchase of the DLC, the players will receive 1 pack each month completely for free. It comprises of two button inputs, now while that may sound quite elementary, underestimated must it be not due to the articulation it has that makes up for a euphoric experience, for indeed inside this brightly lit shell conceals within an engaging rhythmic venture. Originally, Muse Dash is a mobile game available on iOS / Android, this PC port is polished and faithful to its counterparts with higher resolutions and an unlocked frame-rate for fluidity and pure eye candy bliss.  For a rhythm genre enthusiast, it would pose as rather underwhelming however fortunately, there is a higher ""Master"" difficulty unlocked, that cranks things up a notch for a bit of a challenge, but can as well be surmounted with practice.  With such a colorfully charming appeal, ebullient design, ecstatic gameplay at a bang for the buck of a price, Muse Dash makes an excellent candidate for gifting to fellow  ̶w̶e̶e̶b̶s̶ friends.

"Battlefleet Gothic: Armada. First things first, do I recommend it? Wholeheartedly yes! Now that's out of the way, on to my thoughts about this game. I will be say that I've decided to base my review on the feel and atmosphere of this game, it's faithfulness to the feel of the Warhammer 40k universe, especially with an eye to past 40k games. I won't be reviewing it on the gameplay in depth simply because I do not play enough RTSes to feel qualified to make an assessment either way. Is this game faithful to the 40k universe? Very much so I feel. One of the most striking things personally was listening to the soundtrack, the background music, the dialogue, and finding a welcome familiarity about it. It's as if the people in charge of the music at Tindalos Interactive had sat down to listen to all of Dawn of War II's music and dialogue. Some of those ship captains sound like they could be voiced by the Lord General in DoW2: Retribution. The music, with long mournful organ notes and soaring choral performances, is eerily reminiscent of DoW2: Retribution too. This helps the game feel a strong connection with previous 40k titles from Relic. Set against the backdrop of the 12th Black Crusade, the story thrusts you into a pivotal role in fighting against the various enemies of mankind. The weight of expectations lends a tension to each mission, even though mission types are picked from a standardised set. Despite that you do feel a sense of progression and each battle feels unique. The levelling up of ships and your admiral, and the amount of combinations for ship builds, gives you that additional sense of progression, and the motivation to want to win every single battle. Add in epic clashes involving ships of tremendous infamy such as the Terminus Est, and you feel a firm sense that you're right at the heart of the 12th Black Crusade.  I personally also love the difficulty scaling. I think it's perfect. Easy is just about right for casual players like me, normal is challenging, and hard and heroic are perfect for those who're bored easily if they're not juggling 9 chainsaws on fire. Something for everyone, just the way inclusive gaming should be. Conclusion: for any 40k fan who's been bemoaning the lack of any serious 40k titles over the last few years, this is the answer to your prayers to the God-Emperor/Ruinous Powers/Gork & Mork/Greater Good or whoever it is you pray to... heretic. I would recommend it even at its full price, and I hope that more content is to come. The foundations are there for this to be the big spiritual successor to DoW2, and I hope Tindalos Interactive seizes that opportunity with both hands! ",True,False

"RESEÑA FINAL: Actualización 1.05, no sé ssi vayan a seguir actualizand oel juego, pero yo ya no reseñaré más puesto que ya tengo el juego al 100%, por ende ya no tengo más motivos para jugar. Hablan do de la última actualización hasta la fecha, en realidad si ha mejorado un poco el rendimiento del juego, aunque en lo personal considero que la mejor fue la 1.03 ya que era la que menos lag me daba, en la 1.05 si se mejoraron muchas cosas, en muchas más zonas el juego me iba a más de 60 FPS, aunque en las zonas como Meridian siempre solía bajar hasta los 20, pero en la mayor parte del juego no se me hizo muy molesto ya que no solían bajar mucho los frames. Aún hay muchas cosas que mejorar pero EN LOS PERSONAL ya con esta última actualización se me hizo ""jugable"", aunque con peros de bajones, pero nada muy molesto. Hablando de la historia del juego es bastante buena, la disfruté bastante de principio a fin aunque en algunos momentos se me hacía algo tediosa, y el final me parece un poco anticlimático, pero en general me gustó y me dió buenos momentos mi primera partida (No tanto la segunda) pero en general me pareció bastante buena. Los combates en general no solían encantarme cuando de matar humanos se trataba, es más divertido cuando es matar a las máquinas, con los humanos la mayoría de veces aunque las flechas los rozaran no les daba, y para darles en la cabeza era demasiado molesto, pero con las máquinas se hacía bastante entretenido y disfrutable. En general es un buen juego, quizá no de los mejores que haya jugado, pero si lo disfruté bastante en muchos momentos y me dio bastantes horas de diversión y ganas de saber qué va a pasar más adelante. Dejando de lado los problemas técnicos de la versión de PC, es un juego muy disfrutable. 8/10.  ACTUALIZACIÓN DE LA RESEÑA POR EL PARCHE 1.03: Por si quieres saber las  especificacionesde mi PC están más abajo, prosigo con la reseña: Recientemente con la actualización 1.02 estaba empezando a sufrir varios crashes todo el tiempo, jugaba un rato y pum! Crash, todo eso únicamente después de la actualización 1.02, cuando estaba pensando en cambiar la reseña sale la 1.03, y joder, un ""gran"" cambio. Todas las actualizaciones han sido de 1.5 MB, así que están tirando de puro optimizar código, parece. Pero esta vez ha funcionado, con esta nueva Actualización no solo he notado que varias zonas que antes me iban a 30 fps o 25, ahora van entre 40-55, que joder, no son los 60 FPS que esperaba, pero si han cambiado bastante, además de que jugadno 7 horas seguidas no he sufrido ningún crasheo, zonas como las ciudades en dónde se alentaba un poco el juego, ahora vsuele ir mucho mejor, almenos unos 10 FPS mejor que antes. si siguen a este ritmo el juego va a ser perfectamente jugable dentro de un tiempo, me refiero a 60 FPS duros como una roca, pero ahora mismo se puede jugar bastante bien, o almenos mejor que cuando salió, así que si quieres puedes darle una oportunidad ahora si tienes mejor Hardware que el mío. Pero aún no está al 100%, así que queda a tu elección, pero ya no sufro ni de crasheos ni de tanta perdida de frames, así que en mi caso no me quejo del todo, pero espero que en una próxima actualización se haya solucionado del todo :D DEJO CLARO QUE ESTA ES MI EXPERIENCIA A LA HORA DE JUGAR EL JUEGO, Y QUE NO POR QUÉ SER IGUAL A LA TUYA. El juego en general me está gustando bastante, por eso el voto positivo, pero no tengo horas suficientes como para hablar de eso, así que solo hablaré del rendimiento que he tenido EN MI CASO. Por favor leer todos los EDITS porque esta experiencia puede no ser igual a la tuya: Lo probé en un PC con las siguientes especificaciones: GTX 1060 6GB Intel core i5 7500 8GB RAM Monitor 768p Lo probé en este PC a ver qué tal iba de rendimiento Primeramente cuando abres el juego se inicia la configuración, que tarda varios minutos, que ajusta las opciones del juego a tu hardware, automaticamente después de que acaba se inicia el juego, tuve mi primer crasheo (Y único hasta el momento) ahí, se bajaron los FPS y se cerró, lo volví a abrir y se volvió a iniciar la historia, y ya no tuve tantos bajones en ese momento, bajó hasta un máximo de 50 FPS mas o menos, después de la introducción llegas al menú del juego, y pues si quieres cambiar las opciones gráficas, puedes hacerlo, lo ♥♥♥♥ todo el alto. Ahí jugué hasta el momento en el que Aloy se hace adulta, la primera hora vaya, y aparte de algún que otro bajón de fps, no tuve ningún otro problema y se mantuvo siempre a 60 FPS. Así que por el momento no he tenido ninguna falla aparte de algún que otro bajón y el primer crasheo. Actualizaré la reseña a medida que siga jugando, por si obtengo algún otro problema, pero por ahora me ha funcionado bien, pero ten cuidado, porque por lo que veo muchos están teniendo varios problemas aunque no haya sido mi caso Edit, ya voy 4 horas de juego, el rendimiento empieza  abajar bastante más, llegando a los 30 FPS, estando entre 45 y 50 la mayor parte del tiempo, probando varias configuraciones sigue igual :/ Edit 2: Claramente el juego va teniendo muchos problemas, pido que no mires solo mi análisis a la hora de tomar una decisión, la optimización del juego es bastante baja para este momento, y la mayoría de personas está teniendo problemas con crasheos, aunque no haya sido mi caso, recomiendo que esperes un poco si lo vas a comprar, porque es más bien una ruleta rusa de si te vaya a funcionar o no. Mejor espera al próximo parche a ver si lo mejoran Edit 3:(CUIDADO, ESTA GUÍA PUEDE YA NO ESTAR FUNCIONANDO DEBIDO A LAS ACTUALIZACIONES RECIENTES) Encontré una guía que me mejoró una par de fps, por probar vale la pena, siempre y cuando ajustes lo que dice en la guía a tu hardware:  Edit 4: Actualización 1.03: Lo dejé arriba, así que lee ahí jsjs",True,False

"Hard to put the cards in my hands down to write this review. This is hands down one of the best trading card game out there! In this game you play as a newbie entering into the fiercely competitive card scene, in a town where everyone is obsessed over collecting trading cards. The story is like any other adventure game, a heroic quest to battle the Card King and win 1 million coins! But first, you will need to collect a total of 8 legendary cards by contesting against the top players in town to initiate the final showdown against the big boss. Along the way, you will meet and battle various wacky but strangely charming characters (platypus, turnip, fox and more!). Their dialogues are funny and witty, and keep you entertain as you become engross in the gameplay and story. The gameplay is very fun. You will have a starter pack to begin with, and every time you win a battle, receive more cards in the form of booster packs. You can also purchase new cards wih coins, recycle duplicates in exchange for new booster packs or even combine and craft new ones later. You can use a deck of 25-40 cards, according to your strategy, and you can build and save up to 6 of your own custom decks for use during battles. Cards can be divided into rarity (common, uncommon, rare, and legendary), with certain rules such as no more than 1 legendary card can be in your deck. Each card has arrow(s) and action icon(s) attached to it (usually 1 of either attack, defend, or neutral, 2 of revive; but rarer cards may have 2 of attack for example).  Your character always start with 7 hit points, same as your opponent. A flip of coin determines who will place the first card, on a grid of 3x3, almost like a tic-tac-toe. You can only place 1 card each turn. You will need to make sure the arrows face each other to chain at least 3 icons together, with the action based on the dominant icon, in the event of a tie, you will get to choose. Attack can disable a card on the enemy grid (if enemy is unable to form any chain with the grid full and can't place any more cards, you win) or directly reduce the hit points of your enemy (down to 0 and you win), defend adds to your hit points (max of 10), revive can reenable your disabled cards and neutrl is simple to help in forming chain without action on it's own. You will need to think and plan ahead always, if you can't form any chains from the misplaced cards and your board is full, you will lose. Maximize your deck with too many attack cards, and you will find yourself facing difficulties when enemies disable your cards and you don't have enough revive cards to reenable them. A lot of strategy will come into play as you progress and collect more cards. Cards sometimes will have abilities, for example removing a card from the grid, rotating enemy's card to mess with their chain, or even granting immunity until the card itself is diabled or removed. As expected, legendary cards have the most unique and powerful abilities in game. Fighting against AIs is not always easy, and they can seem to be at times ""cheating"" based on luck, but they are definitely no match if you have a good strategy and a solid deck. There is some end game content too, after becoming the champion by beating the Card King, you can go on collecting all cards (over 200 unique cards) and fighting new enemies.  Overall, highly enjoyable card game, you won't go wrong buying it. It is only single player though, which I feel is a shame as a multiplayer mode will definitely be welcome to battle among your friends. ",True,False

"Apex Legends, which I have been playing for about 4 seasons over Origin, has finally come to Steam, the players are happy, what do those who do not use Origin say? It is the game that I like the most among the games of the Battle Royale genre and which I find the most fun. The dynamic tempo it gives, the adrenaline of being fast, in a word, great feelings. Frankly, I am not a person who can handle many Battle Royale games, but unfortunately, I can play it very easily. It is a different beauty that he does not want Origin when entering the game, and it is a different beauty that it is more seriously optimized and presented to us. The only problem is that the DLC prices are a bit salty. It's a bit more expensive than the prices on Origin, unfortunately. The day has come for those who are looking for a free-man-smart Battle Royale, who want a pace that doesn't drop even a little adrenaline, or simply wait for this game to be released on Steam! At least give it a try, you won't lose much. Score: 8/10 ",True,False

Those nasty adventurers have certainly deserved some punishment for their invasions. The mark is 8/10. Solid gameplay, achievements, plenty of content - all you can hope to find in the demo version. And there is much more in the main game! I'm definitely want to buy it now. ",True,False

Headlights are not synchronized nor the engine noise, this somewhat hinders the multiplayer experience. But it's still a lot of fun. ",True,False
"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ВНИМАНИЕ СПОЙЛЕРЫ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! МНЕНИЕ: Ещё одна замечательная игра мира Fallout под названием Fallout: New Vegas. На этот раз игра будет разворачиваться на пустоши Мохаве. И впервые за все части главный герой не из убежища, как всегда, а простой Курьер. Но в игре все равно делается акцент на то, что главный герой относится к ""Убежищу 21"". Что касается прокачки в игре, то здесь все осталось как есть, кроме количества уровней. Если в Fallout 3 было 30 уровней, то теперь их 50. По моим ощущением графика и геймплей по сравнению с предыдущей частью, не очень сильна изменилась. Но карта игры очень сильно изменилась. Появилось большое количество разнообразных локаций и красивых пейзажей. И каждая локация отличается друг от друга. Так же теперь между перестрелками можно поиграть в довольно хорошие и прибыльные Мини-игры. Добавили много разнообразного оружия и брони, а так же увеличилось количество квестов. И да по поводу квестов, если в предыдущей части было не так много интересный квестов, и их можно было пройти двумя или тремя способами. То теперь что не квест то интересное приключение и пройти его можно десятью способами. И у каждого напарника появился свой личный квест, который не так просто получить. Ещё что мне понравилось, так это то что, появились сразу несколько фракций (13 фракций), для которых есть своя репутация. И то что игру можно пройти за одну из трёх организаций (НКР, Легион Цезаря, Мистер Хаус) и против всех (Независимость - Йес-мэн). К сожалению в этой части нас ждут не пять дополнений, а четыре: ""Dead Money"" - последовав за радиосигналом, герой попадает в ловушку к человеку по имени Элайджа (бывший старейшина Братства Стали в Мохаве), который пытается с помощью героя и трёх других персонажей проникнуть в казино Сьерра-Мадре, ""Honest Hearts"" - попав с караванном в национальный парк Зайон, герой становится невольным участником войны между местными племенами дикарей, ""Old World Blues"" - главный герой попадает в довоенный исследовательский центр Большая Гора, в котором ему придётся помочь учёным и разгадать его тайны, ""Lonesome Road"" - герой отправляется в область Пустоши, полностью разрушенную взрывами МБР - Разлом, чтобы найти другого курьера Улисса. В заключении хотелось бы сказать что игра получилась хорошей, но не чувствуется той атмосферы пост апокалипсиса. Кажется что это обычная пустыня в которой происходит война. СЮЖЕТ ИГРЫ: ЗА НКР Действие игры происходит в 2281 году, через 4 года после событий игры Fallout 3 в бывшем Лас-Вегасе, сумевшем благополучно пережить Великую войну. Главный герой - курьер, работающий в фирме ""Мохавский экспресс"". Доставляя очередную посылку, попадает в засаду неизвестной банды и уже без посылки остаётся умирать в неглубокой могиле. Там его находит и откапывает робот-секьюритрон ""Виктор"", после чего относит героя в городок Гудспрингс к местному доктору ""Доку Митчеллу"" - бывший житель ""Убежища 21"". Док излечивает героя и дарит ему Pip-Boy. С начало герой расспрашивает Виктора о нападавших и благодарит его за спасения. После он читает ""Распоряжение о доставке № 6"" и отправляется в ""Примм"", где он впервые встречает солдат ""НКР"" - Новая Калифорнийская Республика. Там же он встречает ""Джонсона Нэша"" - администратора ""Мохаве Экспресс"", и узнаёт от него что именно Виктор заказал у его доставку к северным воротам ""Стрипа Нью-Вегаса"" во ""Фрисайде"" неизвестному получателю 6 разных посылок: шахматную фигуру, игральные кости, платиновую покерную фишку и другие, неизвестные вещи. Затем он спасает ""Помощника Бигла"" от сбежавших преступников. И тот в благодарность говорит что человек в клетчатом костюме вместе с ""Великими Ханами"" пошли в ""Новак"". И после этого Курьер отправляется в Новак, но по пути попадает в ""Ниптон"", где впервые встречает ""Легион Цезаря"" и узнаёт об их неприязни к ""Подрывникам"". Придя наконец то в Новак курьер встречает Мэнни Варгас, и узнаёт от него что человека в клетчатом костюме зовут ""Бении"", и то что он отправился в ""Боулдер-Сити"". Прибыв в ""Боулдер-Сити"" главный герой замечает стычку бойцов НКР и Великих Ханов. Узнав от ""Лейтенантом Монро"" что Ханы взяли в заложники двух бойцов НКР, он тут же решает идти прямо к ним. Там он встречает ""Джесапа"" - одного из Ханов которые на него напали, и уговаривает отпустить заложников и сдаться. После Джесап расскажет, что Бенни, глава ""Председателей"" - заправляющие казино ""Топс"" в Нью-Вегасе, и что они одни из ""Трёх Семьй"" контролирующие Стрип Нью-Вегаса от лица Мистера Хауса. Так же он говорит, что он сбежал, прихватив платиновую фишку и бросив их на произвол судьбы. Придя в Стрип Курьер заходит в казино Топс и встречает Бенни, тот предлагает, успокоится главному герою и приглашает его в президентский люкс. Там Бенни пытается запудрить мозги Курьеру, но он убивает его и забирает Платиновую фишку. А в номере Бенни он находит перепрограммированного ""Последователями Апокалипсиса"" секьюритрона ""Йес-мэна"". После Курьер отправляется к ""Посолу Деннису Крокеру"" и тот рассказывает ему о противостоянии НКР и Легиона. И что планируется битва на Дамбе Гувера и им нужна поддержка от ""Бомбистов"" - это часть выходцев из ""Убежища 34"". Курьер соглашается помочь и отправляется на Авиабазу Неллис. Там он заслуживает их доверие, подняв со дна озера самолёт В-29 и заручается их поддержкой. Затем Крокер просит Курьера убить ""Пейсер"" - члена организации ""Короли"", чтобы прекратить избиения бойцов НКР во Фрисайде. Курьер убивает его, после чего Крокер отправляет его к ""Полковнику Мур"" на дамбе Гувера. Придя туда Мур так же просит Курьера о помощи, и просит его разобраться с Великими Ханами в Каньон Ред-Рок. Там он убивает их главу ""Папу Ханов"", и ставит во главу его помощника ""Риджис"", который соглашается помочь НКР в грядущий битве. После Мур просит разобраться с ""Тримя Семьями"" помогающие Мистеру Хаусу. С начало Курьер убивает всех представителей ""Омерты"" и ставит во главу ""Качино"". После он подставляет и убивает ""Мортимера"" члена Общество ""Белая перчатка"", на что их глава ""Марджори"" обещает покончить с каннибализмом в их обществе. Далее Мур просит убить ""Мистера Хауса"" - единоличного владелец Стрипа Нью-Вегаса, а до войны его звали ""Роберт Эдвин Хаус"" - основатель компании ""РобКо"". Но с начало Курьер проникает в Форт Цезаря, убивает самого ""Цезаря"" (Эдвард Сэллоу), и находит бункер с модернизированными секьюритронами и уничтожает его. Затем он проникает в ""Лаки 38"", находит бункер Мистера Хауса, и убивает его в капсуле жизнеобеспечения. После Мур просит взорвать бункер ""Братство Стали"" в Хидден-Вэли. Но вместо этого Курьер заручается доверием и помощью ""Старейшины Макнамары"" - главы мохавского отделения Братства Стали, в грядущий битве. Далее Курьер встречает ""Аркейда Геннона"" - учёного Последователей Апокалипсиса, и тот предлагает собрать ""Оставшиеся"" - выживших солдат Анклава, чтобы они помогли в грядущей битве. Курьер находит всех выживших и уговаривает их принять участие в битве. Затем Курьер организовывает безопасный приход и отход ""Президента Кимбола"" - президент НКР. После чего ""Генерал Ли Оливер"" - генерал НКР, просит Курьера принять участие в битве за Дамбу Гувера, и в этот момент на Дамбу нападает Легион. С боем Курьер добирается до ""Лагеря Легата"", и убивает самого ""Легата Лани"" - военачальника легиона Цезаря. И благодаря этому Курьер освобождает Мохаве от тирании Цезаря, и награждается НКР ""Золотой ветвью"" - высшей наградой НКР.",True,False

"Not much to say other than this is a little bit different from anything you'll find. You want a cop game? This one does stand on it's own. Get to play a cop in the 80's trying to clear his name from a crime he didn't commit. All this is done by trying to juggle the happiness of the police, the mob and the street hoods. Writing for the dialogue and story is okay, entertaining at the least, but nothing that will knock you off your seat. You could say this is a point and click adventure with how it plays. Each day you have to write tickets and answer various local calls while patrolling your beat. The game boasts that you don't have to get everything done in a day, as you won't have the time to. But honestly, it's all pretty easy and simple once you've got the groove of things. This is a unique game, hard to place it in a genre. But it's not hard to pick up where the story line is taking you in order to make the right choices for a good ending. That being said, not a great amount of replay value.

"The Cherry Orchard is an hour-long retelling of the classic play in a linear visual novel. It plays like a movie in how the story autoplays, and there are no choices to break up the game. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's sure to be a gem for fans of short stories, visual novels, classic literature, and plays who want to experience a refreshing twist. +Pros+ +The Cherry Orchard is based on a classic play, and while condensed, it still maintains and tells a good story. +Artisically, it reminds me of the RWBY anime's animation style with a cyberpunk twist. It's pretty cool art. +The visual novel is mostly animated, and the art style really shines in that. +Length-wise, it wasn't too long, and it wasn't too short, just right to keep viewers' attention. +It features full voice acting that really brings the story to life. +The story auto-plays, which is convenient for a story with no choices and includes pause, back, forward, and act selection features for convenience. +Achievements are available. =Meh= =There were some parts of the animation that looked like they were glitches, but it's later revealed to be intentional and part of the story. It actually worked out great but was a bit distracting at first. =Personally, I was not too fond of the music, but it wasn't awful. I just chose to mute the music and listened to the voice acting on its own instead. =I liked the art, but I can see how some people wouldn't or would have to adjust to it. It's a bit different and unique, but I became fond of it. =The story plays more like a movie than a game since it auto-played on its own, which is fine and worked well in this case, but if you aren't expecting it to be like a movie, you may be surprised or disappointed by the experience. =Kinetic novels are not everyone's cup of tea, and players should understand that The Cherry Orchard tells a good story but does not offer choices. -Cons- -As someone who has seen and knows of the original play, there were some storyline parts cut out or not as fleshed out as they could have been. However, I understand that condensing any material can be difficult, and the story remains clear. -While most of the story was animated, some parts lacked full animation (it was more like traditional visual novel dialogues where the flat characters talk and the expressions changed). The lack of consistency really stuck out. In summary, The Cherry Orchard is a short, yet great kinetic visual novel that tells a good story and features great voice acting, interesting animations, and fantastical art. It's linear with no choices and plays more like a movie than a game, but it still managed to keep my attention and entertained me for about an hour. I would suggest this to fans of visual novels, the original play, classic literature, relaxing storylines, stylized art, short stories, and especially kinetic novel style games. ",True,False

"Perhaps you should devote time to this truly wonderful game based on an equally wonderful universe founded by Dmitry Glukhovsky, whose trilogy of books in the series is known to any self-respecting fan of the post-apocalypse genre. The basis of the plot will be taken from the third book, but we will have to wait for completely original and new events that are no longer associated with the Moscow metro. Just the very beginning. Praise to the creator that the controversial elements of the original source were not included in the game, I had big complaints about the ""merged"" characters, which Glukhovsky purposefully and completely fucked up in the books. But nevertheless, in the game itself, the scriptwriter who is the same Dmitry Alekseevich, did ""work on the mistakes"" of the book and from now on the characters are the strongest side of the game! Throughout the game, we will act as part of an elite unit of the Order of Spartans already familiar to us, each of which is a full-fledged, well-developed personality, you will inevitably empathize with them. I even memorized each by name, and that already means something. By tradition, the ending depends on the passing style. For the first time, I wanted to act as secretly as possible like a real special forces and use firearms against opponents only in the very and most extreme case, not only because all human opponents are people with their own motivation and culture, but the integrity of the detachment can also depend on this by the end games ... It is definitely worth mentioning our life partner. Which, even in military gear, looks damn attractive and is so perfect that you start to envy our protagonist Artem! :) The approach to the final part of the game can already be considered the hallmark of 4A Games. Only one game has caused so much emotion from the finals in my entire life, especially when it comes to the bad ending. I really wanted to shed a tight tear. The same approach was used in the equally interesting story-driven DLC! Which I STRONGLY recommend to purchase. At the time of writing, only ""Two Colonels"" has been released, which fully and completely corresponds to the spirit of the first 1-2 parts of the game. Damn it, even the soundtrack was returned from the first part !! Don't let the trailers and chic graphon fool you. The gameplay is exactly like in the first license plates with the inherent sharp animation of sitting, sprinting and jumping. Which is absolutely not a minus! Rather, on the contrary, after Last Light the game will come in more comfortably. Among the innovations is the system of crafting and looting resources. Which will be used for cleaning and upgrading equipment. Improvements will come to us from fallen opponents, or from hidden caches. Well, the locations themselves. The impenetrable tunnels of the Moscow metro have been replaced by the vastness of the surface world, but this will only be an illusion. The game is still linear, but there are still a few optional assignments that are a sin not to fulfill. Now there is a change of day and night, which also affects the passing style. For stealth, it is better to act at night, but at night mutants are much more active, so you have to choose one of two evils. But there is also a downside to spacious locations - the intelligence of opponents is noticeably lame. A gorgeous game, a great storyline, visuals and settings, at the very end the game returns to its roots and hello again, our beloved beloved mysticism and unexplored deep underground metro tunnels, loneliness, alienation and fear! And in the end, a mean man's tear. In general, 10 out of 10! ",True,False

"Deponia Doomsday is really a successful conclusion to the Deponia series! Those who love the old parts shouldn't miss them. Deponia has always been known for crazy happenings, but this new part tops it all! Time travel, time portals in which, by entering & / or changing, you create a new time loop in which everything runs completely differently than in reality. ""Reality"" is a long way off. In the game, we upset a lot in the first few meters so that the adventure can begin. Together with some new but also many old characters we experience a new adventure & 'experience some things we didn't know because they happened in a different time warp. In the beginning it might be quite confusing, because you are not in the whole story yet. That clears up quickly in the course of the game. As the story progresses, one or the other secret is revealed. You can find out how things happened, although they were represented completely differently in the game (maybe because we are stuck in the time loops for the moment). Rufus initially sees it as fun to play with time & 'would like to rewrite his ending from the third part. In the course of the game, however, it becomes clear to him what he has done with it. He intervened in reality & 'thus created a completely different world. Now we have to straighten everything again & 'experience an almost endless journey through the different existing worlds in the created time loops. Deponia Doomsday is, I like to say it again, the successful conclusion of the series. The new characters give an idea that a new adventure is waiting & 'the old characters make you feel at home. There are of course a lot of snappy comments, detailed dialogues with old friends, beautifully designed mini-games & 'a lot of Rufus' maneuvers. It is a clear buy recommendation for those who do not want to leave the end of part 3 like this. You sometimes experience the previous parts again & 'that's what makes the game, I think. To conclude, let everything happen again. But it is also explained again why you let it end like this. In the end everything happened as it should be seen, Rufus, Goal & 'we have to accept that, because after all, you can't change it. Have fun! (: ",True,False

"Mafia II is the best story game of all time, I think it is the best game to come after Mafia I, even if it was released in 2011, it may be the best of all crime, action, open world games (my opinion) America of the 1930s and 1940s really There are plenty of +18 available drinking women in the game, known events with women, playboy magazines that can be on missions, these are very good details, reflecting almost everything that happened in America of that year. Both the driving and the music, especially the music, we can bribe the cops and get down when our car is completely broken and repair it, etc. makes the game really realistic. Pros (+) Graphics are fine compared to 2011 production. Very good atmosphere. Great story. Realism. Pros too much so I can't count it. Cons (-) The character's inability to swim is actually not exactly - but it doesn't have a clear open world. Actually, you can wander around the open world while going on a mission. There are no side missions, of course, there are dlc's, and the fact that 2K Czech has prevented the game from being made in much greater detail is the biggest - I think. It is a game that I definitely recommend everyone to play. You must play one before you die. Sorry kid, Joe wasn't part of our deal. ",True,False

Even if it's not on sale I suggest you buy it, and make your friends get it, you will have a great time playing trough all the custom levels with your friends! RECOMMENDED! OLD: This is another sad story of a game being deserted by the devs, we waited for a new map and been begging for workshop map support since early 2018 (That is when I bought it) Since then we got ONE new map on halloween / new year 2018, not sure when exactly it came out kinda missed it. Long story short, they been adding skins, and other useless things to make the game look alive, and keep the game selling. So far it does not seem that they are planning to make any large changes for this game, i believe they are working on part 2 which might have workshop map support and more maps.

"""When a quiet and measured life is annoying in hell, the end comes. Because he woke up - the Executioner of Rock. And now take care of your hellish asses. "" The release of the game in 2016 was the biggest surprise for me. At that time, I was not particularly interested in game news and did not even suspect that the new doom had been in development for a long time. And so the game came out. At that time I had a rotten laptop for editing text files and, in fact, I understood that I would not be able to play. Quite a bit, I decided to look at the drop of the playplay, and there ... Super graphics, incredible movement on the screen, blood, intestines, meat, cuts under the metal. I watched all this with a drooping jaw: ""what, in games and the truth is so possible?"". The screen was dominated by a bacchanalia of mash, explosions, killings and destruction. For some reason, I am even impressed by this primitive destructive philosophy: to solve any problem, difficult or not, it is enough to simply kill everyone and destroy everything. Gameplay: Quite fully described in three words: kill, smash, tear. The most unique feature of the gameplay, of course, are the brutal finish. When any devil is tired of the tension of passions during the next batch and decided to boil a little, standing still - at this point you can approach him without a second thought and any pity there and break it. And literally. Finishing in this game is very original - depending on the limb or part of the body, which will catch the eye of the protagonist, will be a unique animation of the murder. Despite all the cruelty of these finishes - it's a real pleasure for the eyes, and just an integral part of the whole gameplay Doom, without which the game would be much more boring. I can't help but mention the double jump, which is now also an integral part of the gameplay. Thanks to him and the ability to cling to surfaces and ledges - significantly increased arcade, which undoubtedly added to the game more opportunities for freedom of movement. A great variety of weapons is the calling card of any old school shooter. But to shoot was more interesting and fun - the developers have added to each of them (except BFG) for two alternative fire modes, each of which can be freely switched directly during the battle, depending on the situation. Also for variety brought and pumping praetorian armor dumslayer, which allows you to be more stable and agile in battle, carry more grenades and be more powerful and effective under reinforcements. Multiplayer: Concentrated batches and fan. Very confusing, very pointless, but fun. A bunch of weapons, maps, modes, thousands of paints and skins - all this is so much that at least the fifth point chew. Very cool made the transformation of time into various demons. The only thing I'm pissed off is a bunch of imbo grenades, which can easily be shot by anyone. Well, BFG, of course. That's what, and BFG in multiplayer is clearly a superfluous element, given the already outspoken Imbo-grenades and demon mode. Most of the ridicule was delivered, from which laughter can be involuntarily emptied - it is simply unrealistic. And so, in principle, in general, you can stick for a maximum of an hour or two in the evening, after work or study. Grafoniy: Very juicy, rich and pleasing to the eye picture. No acid colors. Very deliver special effects, explosions, lighting above all praise, and of course, physics during the brutal killings. Beauty, in a word. If you think about it, restarting DOOM is just heavenly manna, a real, greedy breath of fresh air, a loud and confident revival of the classic, the first-born shooter. It is, in a way, like the phenomenon of a new prophet or Buddha once in a thousand (s) years, when the shooter genre is not to stagnate, but rather a nitrous oxide from endless kolofdutey, batinfields and kaeski. And the players appreciated the updated and reincarnated ""Father"" genre. The game was released with tremendous and resounding success. The Duma is now known again to the whole world, as then, in the 93rd. ",True,False

"JRPG on PC. Already attracting attention, right? Not often Japanese role-playing games come to us on fire, and even more so in 2009. So was this attempt successful? Yes and no. Consider the game in more detail, starting with the benefits: - Great graphics (Unreal Engine knows its business); - Unique turn-based combat system; - A large number of options to customize your mini-army; - More or less worthy of the main storyline (but sometimes the protagonist is a little crazy); And now let's move on to the shortcomings: - The protagonist still hangs out; - almost all quests are not interesting; - a large number of grind (extraction of resources, pumping skills); - without using the game wiki and 100 grams, you will definitely miss a lot of valuable items and do not understand the local leveling system (there are many different classes in the game and it is not clear how to pump them); - Battle Rank system (BR - Battle Rank) is also unclear without wiki; Did I like this game? In 2009, I was delighted with her. But even now this game has its unique advantages, and if you have enough patience and you love the JRPG genre, I see no reason not to give this game a chance. Especially since for its price it offers you ~ 100 hours of gameplay. You will either love her or hate her. ",True,False

One of my favorite competitive games that I have ever played. This game has a learning curve in a very different way. Most games with guns require u just being good at call of duty. This game requires you to be good at throwing flash grenades/smoke having good aim and honestly good communication. My. Main flaws is the price of the skins because this game is free to play some of the skins are costing way too much for what they are worth. Hackers are a thing but this game has a very good review system I think personally. The gameplay gets watched. You'll probably get accused of being a hacker for being good.

"The game tells the story of the protagonist Edith Finch's family, where the heroine walks through the house room by room and reads the diaries of each family member. Each diary contains a short story, where you imagine part of their story in the heroine's fantasy. The house itself is often horror and some of the stories of its inhabitants as well. This game is rather narrative and you can practically not spoil anything about it, it's just that for the first time you notice all the details and achieve 100% archival, or you have to pay tribute. repeat the data game, which will probably not be such fun anymore. The game itself is otherwise quite short and can be completed around 2 hours of pure time, so buying it at full price is a bit of a waste of money ... I like the style of the story, it reminds me a bit of Firewatch with its storytelling, but it was even better . I would recommend the game, but only at a discount, the price of 20 € for this great adventure is too much ",True,False

"I Recommend Steam english What is Steam? Steam is a platform for distributing digital games to computers (Windows, macOS and Linux). Or, trading in children, a digital store. It was one of the first of its kind to be launched and allows consumers to buy or activate games within the service. It has a client program, which must be installed on the computer, so that the games can be maintained, keeping everything up to date. The Steam beta was launched in 2002 by Valve Corporation, a game developer founded by Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington, two former Microsoft programmers (Newell has always been the company's president). The software was designed as a client to distribute updates to the company's own games, specifically Counter-Strike. In 2003, the final version was released, after a large number of testers evaluated the software (between 80 thousand and 300 thousand, according to Valve) Over time, other Valve titles linked to third-party services started to be supported by Steam, until the release of Half-Life 2, the first that required the installation of Steam to run, crucial to the platform's popularity. Soon afterwards, expansion plans began. In 2005, Valve started negotiating agreements with other developers so that they could start selling their games through Steam, with a 30% commission reverted to Valve. Beginning in 2007, major studios such as id Software (DOOM), Capcom (Street Fighter) and Eidos Interactive (Tomb Raider), started releasing their titles on Steam, which encouraged other studios. Today, the platform is the most popular for computer games, with a huge library of AAA and independent titles, whose studios have always been supported by Valve. English What is Steam?

"In total, Lara's Nightmare and Blood Ties with all the achievements will take about the same time as Baba Yaga alone, but I was more interested in the secrets of Lara's house than the witch from Siberia. In ""Blood Ties"" we have to figuratively ""protect"" the family estate from the encroachments of Lara's uncle, Atlas. Discovering new facts from the past of the Croft family (as well as the secret rooms in the estate), we learn more about Lord Croft and his wife, the mother of our beloved plunderer. They will reveal to us the story of the acquaintance of parents and a little closer understanding of the reason for the madness of Lara's father, tell about the beginning of his obsession with immortality. All dlc is like a heroin parish. Actually, what else could be a nightmare? All according to the canon, Lara stands in the middle of the room, in the hands of a revolver, and the estate is filled with heaps of zombies, led by evil flying skulls, which are controlled by another largest skull with the voice of Atlas' uncle (!). The shortest duration for a lara, all achievements are knocked out in one playthrough and it takes a maximum (!) Of half an hour. But the impressions remain good, let's just say :) I was not particularly pleased with the news that the developers issued a new hardcore mode, which is excellent only for the lack of saving outside the camps. But the sadness was not long, the passage took a little time, since there are no difficult moments before the salvation of Jonah. Seriously, the enemies are stupid and only bombardment with Molotov cocktails put Lara out of action. However, a serious kipish began at the final stage of the game, after the last bonfire, at the battle with the boss, I had as many deaths as not during the entire campaign. Actually, what am I for.

"Here is my evaluation for this Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China, embellished with personal notes below the sections. ❤ Public ❤ ☐ Children ☐ All ages ☑ Adults ☐ ⚠ ⚠ Informed public ⚠⚠ Not particularly violent, nor complex to understand. Accessible to all adults. ☼ Graphics ☼ ☐ Bad ☐ Average ☑ Good ☐ Very beautiful ☐ Fantastic Very embossed graphics in Chinese style. Some of the views from the top of buildings are magnificent. It's varied and if we appreciate this civilization it's really pleasant. Special mention to all the cutscenes in the form of ink drawings in the Chinese style, which are beautiful. ♬ Music ♬ ☐ Bad ☐ Average ☑ Good ☐ Very good ☐ Fantastic Very Chinese music and quite present, I like it a lot. The sound effects are also well done. ☠ Difficulty ☠ ☐ Easy ☑ Medium ☐ Easy to learn / Difficult to master ☐ Difficult ☐ Very difficult In itself, finishing the game is accessible to all even if certain phases require a fairly demanding timer. Avoiding combat and fleeing in the event of an alert is the key to guaranteed success. On the other hand, to finish each passage in gold medal you will need a little more control. § Bugs § ☐ The game itself is a bug ☐ A lot of bugs ☐ A few bugs ☑ Rarely bugs ☐ No bugs encountered ☯ Scenario ☯ ☐ No scenario ☐ Bad ☑ Average ☐ Good ☐ Very good ☐ Fantastic Very classic scenario. We remain in an assassins vs Templar scheme, the latter being represented by the Order of the Tigers, leaders well protected in their fortresses that you will have to find and kill. You are therefore the last survivor of a massacre who wants to take revenge and hunt down each tiger one by one. ⚔ Gameplay ⚔ ☐ Bad, not suitable ☐ Average ☑ Well suited ☐ Fun ☑ Technique Gameplay very nervous at times, requiring patience at other times. The infiltration phases are very successful. On the other hand, bad point in terms of the configuration of the keyboard keys, which only allow the basic actions to be recalibrated. Suddenly for some controls (parry / dodge a shot) the key is unchangeable and not at all intuitive. And it's even worse for the ""special movement"" function which requires Ctrl + Shift at the same time to be activated and therefore changes my keyboard to Qwerty, making the rest of the movement impossible. Apart from that the 2D is very well managed with a very good in-depth movement allowing you to change plan. Very interesting idea and well exploited. ۞ Lifespan ۞ ☐ Very short (0-3 hours) ☐ Short (4-8 hours) ☑ Medium (10-20 hours) ☐ Long (40-60 hours) ☐ Very long (61-100 hours) ☐ Very long (101+ hours) About ten hours, enough to see some nice landscapes and to understand all aspects of the game. A + part is possible in order to do all the challenges and improvements. $ Quality / price ratio $ ☐ To buy with your eyes closed ☐ Good investment ☑ In reduction only ☐ Do not buy In conclusion, a good infiltration game in 2D with good depth management. If the scenario and the gameplay remain classic, the atmosphere and the style of the game are a very pleasant element and we really have this impression of feudal China. To be taken as a supplement for any AC fan, if you are not a big fan of other games like Mark of the Ninja are certainly to be preferred. ",True,False

"An atmospheric horror game with a narrative that questions the existence of existing, life. afterlife and death. The story revolves around a naive man that came in for a brain scan, only to end up in an underground water faciilty. He attempts to find a way to escape but ends up finding things much more complicated and completely disturbed by the truth and mystery of the facility and its current and former residents. To be frank, there's nothing much for me to say except that the story and mysteries are quite immersive that its one of the few games I remembered for having the most memorable story and ending.  As a horror game, it's okay if you're just running away from monsters. It plays out well as a psychological horror however. The game is incredibly suspenseful with a gameplay that you do little with the mechanics by using your brain with basic controls. The game can occasionally be quite draining if you are constantly pursued by the monster or always waiting for it to go away. The audio and scenic visuals are quite good. As the sound effects feels quite realistic and the voice acting quite natural. The location, landscape and level design for the areas you visit are either scenic or just different that it feels or looks good. This is how I feel about the game and it truely comes to my highest recommendation for narrative, back stories and exploration of the underwater environment and its facilities. ",True,False
"If you are a moved suitor, a player who is full of sensibility and likes to taste the story. Then the winner of the 2011 Best Story of the Year award is definitely a high-quality game you can’t miss! Although it is a game completed by an RPG master, it is more like a visual novel—the whole game has only one battle, and the rest All are constructed by dialogue, searching for objects, and simple puzzle solving. The story begins with two physicians visiting a dying old man with a machine that can modify his memory. In order to fulfill the old man's wish of ""Going to the Moon"", he embarked on a spiritual journey. The timeline is retrograde to the past, as if watching a video tape backwards, never grasping the result of the clue, finding the reason for the beginning all the way; with each key item, bringing in younger memories, the story becomes clearer and sadder... If you have ever watched ""inception"", the interpretation of dreams and memories is the same, but the story of ""Going to the Moon"" is more warm and tearful. The overall game time is about 4 to 5 hours, which is very suitable for a free night to enjoy as a movie or a novel; I have to say that in addition to the delicate screenwriting, the warm music of the game is also a big selling point, allowing you to taste At the same time as the story, listen to its soundtrack. On a lonely night, why not just make a cup of coffee and enjoy the story! ",True,False

"Wow... I am amazed how good the story pulled me in. Never before have I experienced such emotions in a game besides The Last of Us. The story is amazing and thats all I can say without spoiling anything. The mechanics are also good, but the one thing I found annoying was that I sometimes accidentally tried to zoom in with the RMB resulting in wasted salts.  The soundtrack was freaking amazing and truly authentic on my part. Regaring the weapons in the game I was more than satisfied with the selection and the most interesting thing I found out of all of them was the sky hook which is an amazing weapon as it delivers brutal kills through the game and serves as a great escape tactic. I for one have used it so many times in 1999 mode. Burial at sea 1&2: A masterpiece as well. Though part 1 did not have me convinced the second part delivered. The peeping tom was one of my favotite things to ♥♥♥♥ with the enemy and helped me a lot in a sticky situation. The story on Burial at sea was on the same level if not greater as Infinite. Loved getting information obout Booker, Elizabeth, Big Daddy and little sisters as some of the things were not explained in previous games.  Clash in the clouds: A fun little game if you ask me. Provided me with countless hours of gametime trying to complete all the waves and truly challenging to complete all the challenges. The only part I didn't like about the game was the ending. I was not convinced by it and felt confused a long time after it. I would change the last chapter of the game, but other than that the game is awesome. All around this game is DA BOMB! You will be sorry if you don't get a chance to play it. In some parts I enjoyed the game like a movie as the story was so damn good. I would gladly pay double the price it was originaly worth for this masterpiece. A solid 9.5/10 ",True,False

"A typical linear single player FPS game but really interesting in my opinion not because I'm an Alien's fan haha! You can play as Human(Marine), Predator and Alien but the best to play is Predator because I had issues with the others 2 - guns play in Marine Campaign is really bad like the rifle and the pistol is almost useless against the Xenomorphs best way to play through this campain is using a shotgun and a sniper rifle, Alien Campaign on the other hand is alright but the camera angle when you crawling on walls is kind of threw me off abit so I just force myself to finish as fast as possible. The thing that I dislike the most is when you play as Predator and Alien you supposed to be stealthy most of the time like in the movies but the game mechanic just so bad it's hurt to do so. Total play time must be around 7-8 hours for all 3 campaigns which is playing on the same maps just different playstyles,paths and objectives.

"I have played many 4X strategy games, and this is my first Steam review.  - Why am I giving this a review? Because the Dominions series has been a breath of fresh air to my number-crunching, grand-strategising self, capturing a niche in the market which other games just don't fill:  (TL:DR - summary of other titles here, skip to below if desired) *Speaking from a single player perspective*: AoW is nice, but becomes a 'Tier-4 Spamfest' with rampantly-scaling economies which sadly grows dull (and leads to unfinished games). Civ gets boring after a while, especially the routine tactics dealing with spam-fest nature of AI bonuses on diety levels (I like a challenge to be a challenge, not a grind). Fallen Enchantress is more of the same with dull endless hordes and cheese tactics late-game (little challenge). TW games tend to be broken down into economy, doom-stacks, horribly fast battlefield sludgefests and dodgy movements/abuse of AI. Endless Legend is a nice touch and with reasonable late-game scaling, but still becomes predictable. Warlock could have been a great game, but the AI was useless, the game abandoned, and the MP scene with it. Warband was cool, but becomes repetitive after a while (looking forward to the next though).  Do I know what I am talking about? I would hope so, after over 1000 hours racked up on such games (including MP). (TL:DR over) So why do I love the Dominion series? Surely it can get predictable, abusable and dull just like the rest? *Note: I have recently discovered it, and am only on about 40 hours playtime so far* - Firstly: replayability. So many nations and so much diversity, troop types, magic paths, ways to influence both game and battlefield.  - Secondly: RPG and character investment: the choice of characters, magic items, possible abilities, etc., is huge. And yes, your beloved mage with great equipment and boosted magic paths *will* die horribly in the end....maybe...probably. - Thirdly: surprises and strategies. Even the AI, using more basic AI strategy, will catch you off guard with new unit types, spells, mage-heavy armies, flyers and cavalry taking out your back lines, large armies or elite squads you didn't see coming, and attacks on your weak flanks. - Fourthly: pace. If you are a serious and patient strategist, you will get great pleasure out of the development of your empire and borders. The diversity of potential magic sites, Thrones, bonuses, and special units you can attain is great, and the strategic vs min/max layer of fort placement and province defense is also great - Fifth: customisation. Setting up a game with 'story events' turned on and finding your capital assailed by demon horsemen who you are not ready to take out is.... amusing. Customisation of victory conditions and team games is fine, and it all adds to varying experiences and challenges - Sixth: learning curve progression. I have not even ventured into Multiplayer yet, still learning to 'get gud' in SP - but I am aware MP is where the real skill and strategy lies. By about the point where the game could get dry and I can actively use strategies which dominate any AI, congratulations to me... I am ready to get stomped in MP by strategies based on pre-planned empire/magic/troop designs and advanced reactions to the strategies/army-comp/item-use I am implementing.  - Seventh: no other game combines all these elements and options for me - Eighth: the game seems to do a reasonable job of balancing and scaling. Sure, the way to pull ahead is to have more provinces, meaning stronger economy and more troops....but you have to know how to use it, and multiple opponents can still pull you down. Economy scaling is not a thing like it is in other titles, where the percentages get silly. - Ninth: when you learn cool tactics, spells, blesses, designs and strategies which walk all over the AI, SP is not over! you can simply challenge yourself by not setting up a nation in this way, with those bless designs or magic paths. Restrictions (i.e. not resorting to overwhelming strategies the AI can't cope with) do not need to feel like restrictions *as in other titles* - simply design choice and a new challenge, a new race to learn and a new way to play them Negatives or alternate arguments: - is the game worth the price, and is it enough of an improvement on Dom4? To me, yes. It adds enough, and brings new possibilities. As someone who enjoys the titles, I am happy paying up knowing the game should continue to improve. If there are expansions, I will also buy those.  - What about if you are strapped for cash? You can get enough of a Dominions experience from Dom4, so if you already have it... you could wait for sale if you don't like the price.  - If, however, you don't own Dom4... get this. - If you *really* like Dom4... get this. It is an improvement - If you don't have as much patience as you thought you did, or need quick-fix strategy games... maybe watch YouTube videos first.  - If you don't want a game with a steep learning curve, where *only* many hours invested will give you any sense of how to play the game.... turn away. Run. You are not the market this game is reaching out to. In other negative news, my super-mages died. Horribly. Disease is a thing, as are arrows, centaurs, assassins, drownings, elemental effects, and cyclopses. This lengthy report comes to you from a very good 4X player (max difficulty other titles), an intermediate Dom5 noob, and Dom5 multiplayer virgin soon to be crushed by ethereal bless effects, supercombatants, and stealthy raids on all my provinces. I might even enjoy it.",True,False

"A very cool tactic that skillfully combines both the simplicity of the mechanics of the new ikcoms and the depth of pumping of Japanese RPGs. On the one hand, there are two actions and skills, two types of cover, overwatch, smoke grenades, that's all. On the other hand, there are several hundred (!!!) perks - ""skills"". For every taste, from + 5% to the chance of crit to automatic attacks on an enemy who was not finished off by another character, counterattacks and counter-shots, and some generally specific yoba like healing all debuffs when healed. And all this still makes synergy with each other, both literally and figuratively - you can yourself collect something like ""automatic strengthening of cover after a shot, block and dodge buff after strengthening cover and acceleration when the enemy misses"" m get an absolutely impenetrable creature in cover, or you can stupidly collect a prescribed set of perks and get a plus to the chances of crits and the damage of a counterattack. Well, to all this, pumping characters in three classes with the opening of abilities and the selection of equipment. Builds, builds and builds again. In general, there is where to accelerate. And the game situations match - even in the very last mission (according to my counter it was 104), the developers put forward a new type of opponents for me - sniper shots supporting each other, each of whom could critically one-shot any of my fighters. So there is no ""it became too easy"" syndrome in the game, it will always be difficult, the last level turned into a heroic overcoming and exchange, and I replayed a hopeless one-on-one duel between the pistol and the new boss of the cultists eight times, but I never mastered it. Since we are talking about cultists, then we can also talk about the plot - a game about gang warfare in a city-state. In a kind of stable system of balance between the groups of the Evil Bull, White and Black Tigers and the Spoon cult, a detachment of state mercenaries, led by the main character, intervenes and breaks the whole balance of power to hell. The plot is generally not easy, there is no single storyline of any kind of revenge, instead there is a whole bunch of intersecting stories that do not always have a beginning and an end - this is the story of a town of the poor destroyed ten years ago, and the struggle within the clan for the title of leader, and political showdowns, and experiments, and the story of the chief of the riot police, and some recollections of the owner of the bar, and the fuss of a mafia officer with a girl murderer and so on. All this must be read and kept in mind in order to form an integral picture. I'm fine, but many will not go, besides that some plots are clearly not finished, but taking into account all the fancy stuff, I can't even imagine how many hundreds of hours a ""full"" plot will take. Our squad consists of nine heroes, but they are given them very slowly, once every ten hours, and also a special forces squad is almost always given to help, which will drag us for us at the beginning of the game, but in the end it will barely support us. Heroes are very diverse, each can be pumped into two classes, and taking into account the perks and equipment, the number of combinations is infinite, my Albus got 90% evasion and just stood in the middle of the battle and counterattacked the attackers of the nodamag, but losing two-thirds of his hits if the evasion did not work , so I had to always keep the healer nearby, but I could well become an air mage and hit from a distance with ranged attacks. Yes, there is magic in this world, but it is such, all scientific and modern, the ice mage walks here with a drip of antifreeze so that his heart does not stop. Missions are divided into storyline, regular, request and violent cases - long drawn-out missions with a bunch of bosses, all this can be endlessly replayed in order to farm perks and sets, and there is also craft and systems for training animals and collecting droids, and I don't even penetrated, because then the counter would show not 80 hours, but three hundred. At the moment, the game can be called complete, despite several interrupted storylines, six chapters with eight story missions, each of which can take up to an hour. The developers were very confused with their ""episodes"", which were later recalled in the ""season"", it is better not to delve into this. Very, very cool tactics in an interesting world.

"It doesn't matter! Firing blocks through the air ... Good question! I just started it and was amazed at how many successes fly up in the corner after clicking a red block. After level 5 or 6, I slowly realized what the point of the game was! You have to bring the little blue block onto the green area! A puzzle game! So you click on a red block, there is an explosion and all the blocks fly through the virtual air ... Now the blue block should land on the green surface and not fall down. Simple but fun! Very block-heavy, in color and multicolored ... After 20 minutes I had all the successes and a card. Now with the achievements I can write funny words on my profile and have one more perfect game. It was fun, it didn't cost much. Especially since I've already spent more money on shorter or less fun. So if you are looking for something short for in between, buy. If you want to have more than 100 successes in 20 minutes, buy. If you want a perfect game after 20 minutes, buy it. If you have another 20 minutes after 20 minutes, Zup! Buy 2! If you want to write something with the successes in the showcase, buy. The only question left is, how long do I have to let the game run to get the last cards, because to be honest, I'm not playing this again!

It was a long time ago, but a friend invited me to try it. Overall, it was a fun game. (But before playing, but everyone should know the Battle Realm 555+) Advantages 1. A very good time killing game. Can play free to solve boredom And very difficult to tell (now stuck). 2. Soldiers are not too cluttered. 3. There is a co-op story mode as well (not confident. Because never played, but saw that there is a choice) 4. Do not eat specification 5. There are many countries And the ability of each country is not the same (must play the Asian Dynasty Version, because it is a sector that can be played by all countries + tribes. Don't worry, it's free;)) 6. Can play 8 people! If not enough people can bot or hit each other, it's good hahaha. 7. Beautiful town. If compared to the old games 8. Good story. Disadvantages 1. This game is not developed further. But the server has to play (There may be some rot) 2. Expensive, wait to reduce TT 3. People play very little. The world has about 1000+ itself (should play with friends to be the best) 4. The system is a little difficult to understand.

"F.E.A.R. game, released for the European community on October 18 (for Russian October 27), 2005, left a trace of cruel injustice in me. And I'm not talking about the difference between the release of the game this year! And about a dramatic story that can boldly compete with Indian melodramas with their unexpected twists, and the horror film ""Mama""! It is also an atmospheric, and dark hallway, survival shooter, because the AI ​​that works against you here really wants to kill you! It will be difficult to kill without ""slowmo"" which simulates the burst of adrenaline in the blood and slows down the movement of enemies for a while, but if you like hardcore, this is for you, especially on a high difficulty level. And this is the level! Which is not present in modern shooters, hmm .. I would also like to note that there are elements of horror in the toy (oh well, bl * !?), so that the traveler would be distracted from crazy shooting, and laid out a brick in a cramped corridor.

"I didn’t buy this game through charity (after all, I’m not a big brother). The earliest I found it was a discounted mini game. At the beginning, I was attracted by music. After that, I found it was a good game and kept playing. Go down. Later, a friend who was familiar with electronic music told me that the composition of this game, EnV, was also famous in the electronic music industry. In general, buying music and giving away games is not a loss. This game is not only excellent in BGM, but also in terms of sound effects. The protagonist's own sound effects are not many, but they can be perfectly integrated into the BGM. In some levels, there will be a scene of leaves scattered in the background. At this time, there will be a sound effect similar to the scattered iron pieces, and the activation of the teleport point will have bass and bass. The soprano groans, the sound effects of the scene are not much, but it is also very ""grabbing"". In general, ESJ's performance in vocal music is not rich but absolutely amazing. I don’t know why I use this word to describe the art style of this game, but I remember that the games in a certain art collection package are all painted styles made up of a large number of color blocks, so I will use this for now word. Although this style is acceptable to me, it is nothing more. At any rate, I am also a half post-worker. This kind of picture composed of several shape layers with AE stacks is really hard for my concubines. Fortunately, the colors in most levels make people feel more comfortable, and of course there are a small amount of weirdness. For this kind of corpse game, ESJ's operating feel is obviously qualified. The action feedback is very fast, and the jumping protection system is added (detailed below). Characters have different characteristics at different stages, such as slamming, floating, low gravity, etc. Levels will change into different styles according to their characteristics. Although this mode is cheap for platform jumping games, it is very cost-effective, allowing players to stay alive in the high-precision and high-intensity process. In contrast, a famous fan series is very unpleasant to players, which is why it is extremely niche. (Platform protection is simply a design to reduce the probability of players falling off the platform. There are two main types. The first is that the characters will freeze for a while before falling off the edge of the platform. Use this very if you want to complete the extreme jump. Early Many of the horizontal version games have similar designs, but this solution will reduce the smoothness of the game, and it is not hard-core enough! So in most of the later horizontal version games, designers mostly adopt the second solution-in The character can still jump when one foot has obviously stepped out of the platform and started to fall. Because most people play the platform game conservatively, only the character intends to jump as soon as they reach the edge, but sometimes there will be a hand heel. If you fall off the platform without thinking about it, this design just avoids such situations. ESJ uses the second set of solutions, this design can help most players to pass the first three worlds in this article. ) There is another feature in the level design, which is optimized for speed running. The general platform jumping game has the problem of choosing the timing, and ESJ is the best time when it is born from the archive point. As long as you can ensure the fastest progress throughout the entire journey, the monster's landing point and the movement of the platform appear in the right place. With these optimizations, players can play very pleasing speed-passing videos. At present, a lot of independent platform jumping games seem to be developing in this direction (I have played several high-level platforms with this design), but from the other side, this design also limits the possible solutions in platform jumping games. Mystery element (mainly to find a suitable route for clearance), because you can easily find the best route. However, when I collected all the hidden elements to open the fourth world, I discovered that there were multi-line levels in the fourth world. And one of the levels completely subverted my understanding of horizontal platform jumping games. As for what it looks like, just sell it and leave it to everyone to try (you need to collect 22 stars in the first three worlds to open the fourth world). Although ESJ has occasional innovations in level design, it can only be considered quite satisfactory overall, but the quality of the level is still quite guaranteed. After so many years of development, it is not easy to make new breakthroughs in the horizontal platform. It is not an exaggeration to give a score of 9 in terms of auditory experience, and it is more comfortable to experience multi-faceted music with integrated feel (provided that you are not very handicapped).

The human civilization is in total ruin, and the only survivors are the so-called Revenants – vampires with superpowers who live in a community known as Vein. Its members abandoned their humanity and most of their memories to survive in a new, harsh reality. However, they are far from accepting their fate and try to unfold the secrets of the fallen world. They must also suck blood regularly, or they will transform into blood-lusting monsters. During world exporing we will find a lot of new friends which we can help to find Vestiges. Collecting them all allows us to know their mysterious past and restore their memories. The gameplay of Code Vein takes after the tradition of the Dark Souls series. We exploring locations that aren’t clearly separated and fighting with various enemies, including powerful bosses. There is also the blood-sucking mechanic that plays a major part in the game, and is implemented by using Blood Veil, which also acts as an armor. After successful Drain Attack, we will gain Ichor which allows us to use Gifts – special abilities with various effects, ranging from strengthening our character, through weakening enemies, up to direct attacks on them. Blood Veil appears in many shapes and forms, as do characters’ skills and weapons, letting us use various strategies. One of the important elements of Code Vein is a system that lets us play with an AI-controlled companion. We select the companion from non-playable heroes, who become more numerous as we progress through the game. This allows us to complete tasks that would be too much of a challenge for a single adventurer. However, our friend isn’t just there to help us in combat – he can аct by himself and his actions might result in situations which will require our support. The game is fully voiced and the Japanese voices are pretty damn good. Also I tried English dub and it's pretty nice too. But the most my favorite thing in this game are soundtracks.

"Though it took Rockstar an absurd duration to prepare the PC version of GTA V, it's a slam dunk by all accounts. Facilely the best GTA yet, especially when multiplayer is taken into consideration. With massive replay value, great graphics, relishable gameplay, and lots more going for it, GTA V is a game that any player would be hard-pressed not to relish. From raging shootouts to daring getaways, GTA V is a game that's hard to step away from once you commence playing. Fantastic levels of customization for your attire, cars, and hair. The well-indited dialogue and voice acting avail to bring Los Santos to life as you ride through a bustling downtown, or take a relaxing drive through the mountains. Time and time again you'll turn a corner and find yourself consummate surprised at what you find there. You could facilely waste hours just poking around the environment. There is something here for everyone. With a sizably voluminous graphical jump from GTA IV, GTA V brings us the city of Los Santos, in grand detail, from the towering Skyscrapers to the pulchritudinous mountains. You'll find yourself perpetually surprised by the caliber of detail that Rockstar put into this massive world. Gorgeous lighting effects, incredible weather effects, fantastic audio, and smooth animations converge to immerse you in Los Santos on a whole incipient caliber, especially when you check out First Person mode. As with most games though, faces leave something to be desired, though they are a sizably voluminous leap from GTA IV. The decent length story to go through, which spans across multiple intertwining characters. GTA V distributes another decent story by Rockstar. Though not concretely enthralling for the first bit, it certainly picks up the pace as it gets further along. You'll meet some fantastically outlandish characters in typical Rockstar fashion, and get caught up in some cockamamy events. GTA V accomplishes what it sets out to be, a blast from start to culminate.

But it's quite a straight line. Which is good But sometimes it ends up a little too quickly. Not much open to the world like in the past. - Various high-tech devices, of course, who likes something like this is definitely available to play. - quite easy to play Because of that, with modern equipment Making war makes it easier. But it can be fun - It is a slow-moving play that hits the hearts of teenagers, but whoever does not, may be dizzy, puke, and laughter. Will not be liked for some - From the old sector, the characters will be able to play as many people, positions, and stories and connect them together. But in this part, as I said honestly, just play the protagonist. - I don't really penetrate the character's story, so I don't have a connection like Modern Warfare. I do not know who it came from. Suddenly it is a friend. We will die, it will disappear. Stubborn until the game ends. But the death of some people is still a little inviting. - Finally, this is a personal irritation. Why zombies have to buy DLC to play? Let's hope to play Exo Zombies more than the story. Can't help waiting to buy the discount period page 55 - and it's already abandoned Multiplayer. Will come try to touch it, it will not disappoint. Try to adjust the level difficult. It will be a lot more fun. Score 7.5 / 10 Lastly, it is still a good game. Try to buy it, it won't hurt anything.

"Counter Strike - Blessing or Curse Since the development of Counter Strike as a Half Life Mod and its public release in 1999 - to Counter Strike Source - until its biggest step and latest release with Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the Game Series still is the unbeaten King of First Person Multyplayer Tactic Shooters - and just a legendary Game. With its recent breakthrough in the professional Esports scene and the growing hype - we can only dream about how the Scene will evolve in the future.  I never seen or played a game that kept me interested and amused without ever getting bored in such a long time now. The Game architecture, technics and balance of the whole package including the maps is almost perfectly genius, but although still complex. By offering tasks striving thereon is only little space wether to succeed or fail in the relentless competition. the process of desicion making is important and confrontations like this can help improve your selfawareness and selfconfidence. The smart Ranking System added with CS:GO offers a whole new improved exiting user experience.  The obvious moment a new unprofiled Gamer realizes there will always be someone better & faster then him (in that case ME myself and I) a hook accures that boosts the motivation and grieve to optimize and perfect your skills needed to consist and improve in many positive ways and to stand a chance, not only virtualy but carried over to many situations triggering self development. Counter Strike Global Offensive is the best example that FPS-Gaming is not only a waste of time or the reason for columbine highschool shootings. It rather triggers that considerable drive to improve your skillset while simultaneously offering the oportunity to have fun and interact with like-minded players around the world - share and learn new exotic foreign languages, words and phrases, to recognize bad influences and behavior and last but not least to kill them! With an interactive community developing and adding new features, addons like new maps, skins or even Server scripts Counter Strike is at its alltime high.  Akira is a Zevel..

"Fantasy comic adventure, similar to the popular paper adventure books previously.

Yes, there are a few questionable design choices (one being a late game dungeon that shall not be named) but all in all the good far outweighed the bad and in the end I got a really nice ending sequence that I was working towards during the whole game and the choices I made. As far as bugs are concerned: I encounted a few (once being stuck in slow-walking from exhaustion that could only be fixed with reloading), a few crashes here and there and one broken save file that always crashed at the same time (luckily I had made another save just prior).

"If you like painful and stunning experiences, this is the game for you. I've never been so psyched in my entire life. I personally enjoy these games because most of them just throw you at you and don't give you the feeling of a goal, much less a beginning or an ending, it ends when it ends and it begins when it begins. On the other hand, the price range is quite adequate, I only spent a good amount of time on this game, and I'm at a point where I'm at 5 o'clock (as you've probably read this, it skyrocketed dramatically)) I'm a college student and this is a very stressful game in my opinion and I really enjoy the general perspective of the game, I think we should do more games like this, or at least the same general zero objective look and you find out, you learn from your mistakes, etc. The only downside to this game is that there is a hunger bar and minimal inventory space, however you can upgrade this later in the game, but you are constantly collecting items and getting your currency, but you lose space quickly. With the hunger bar, it decreases as you run, which is logical, but it can get quite irritating when you find yourself in a dangerous situation like bees or a masked tree trying to kill you. Overall Rating: 9.7 / 10, I would definitely recommend this game if it fits your requirements in a game, and be sure to check below recommended, the developer has made more games like this :) ",True,False

"What will you think being at Crea's storepage for the first time? ""Oh, once again a sandboxy Terraria clone."" But be sure that won't be precisely right. Of course, we can't deny there are similarities in both games as well as in the genre in general. That's why being a fan of lookalike titles you are always looking for something new and innovative to be in the forthcoming product. And truly, Crea possess some interesting elements and features which make it distinctive compared to its predecessors. Without further go, I really enjoyed Crea. It might look similar for the newcomers at the beginning as you are thrown into the world, given some instructions and set to go. However, the further you progress the deeper game immersion becomes. As usual, you gather materials, kill monsters, craft gear and build a home for yourself. Then you dive deeper or travel farther to explore new horizons repeating all that on a greater scale. Sounds familiar, indeed, but there is more to it than what is seen plainly on surface.  The most developed and well designed part of game is crafting system. It's interesting, it's catchy and what's even more important it's complex. You can't just ""I got the deer muscus now I can make an *Uber 2156 Annihilator Optimus  "". Here you have to actually research each material figuring its specifications and how and where it can be used - and you will need to do that several times learning more and more of a particular item as your researching (crafting) level increases and so do your skills. Therefore great or just regular items can be created when you collect enough materials to both analyze and use them in the crafting process. Though sometimes you can find prepared recipes as well. There are only few stations each usable for certain categories of items. You can ""improve"" them by finding (mostly in random chests) different techpieces. What's absolutely worth mentioning is 'Chaos system' which allows you to craft better items giving them additional stats or special characteristics depending on how well you manage to keep the ""Chaos"" from ruining your work using different features and talents to do so (that's sort of hard to explain in the review but I hope main point is still comprehensible).  Next, there is also an extended talents ""tree"" with different branches. You gain points by running around, killing monsters, shooting   fireballs, breaking blocks and crafting and then allocate them to affiliated sections thus learning new fighting techniques and new spells as well as improving yourself and your more pacific skills generally. There are quite enough of such abilities so you won't be bored and can always try playing a new style, like battlemage or rogue-archer.  Finally, lets talk about the world you are in and its content. As usual, you can create several sizes where each will have ground, sky and underground levels with different biomes. You can travel only by foot or by crystal waypoints, unfortunately, but who knows if wings or transport will be added in the future updates - that would surely be nice. Monster are unique and each has its own style and combat pattern so as abilities while some may be challenging to face in the early stage. There aren't many monsters though, to be honest. Bosses prove to be even more tough and provide a necessary degree of ""buttpain"" if you don't master evasion or figure what is the right way to fight them. Exploration aspect is solid enough with many caves and hidden goodies underground like chests or rooms with pages about the preset or world's past.  Rather doable element is fighting/gathering: you have to switch between 2 modes which also have two tabs each which might be confusing a bit to those who were previously playing games like Terraria, for instance. You will constantly need to switch to fighting if you are mining underground, but It's still somewhat versatile system in the end. In-game animations are well done and lovely (except for the jumping). Graphics is pretty common to the genre but still has some charm to it mostly due to beautiful and full-blooded arts, though backgrounds are rather simple. Effects are stylish and there is physics in place - shooting ball of earth may destroy a block or drop icicles from the ceiling which will damage enemies when fall, for example. Main game menu is simple too but that's not to be concerned of. Interface is fine but small improvements could still be added (for example, bigger fonts). Soundtrack is nice and plausible to hear. Technically, there is nothing to be concerned of. Game is out of Early Access and was granted almost bugless state. The only issues I had so far are two crashes which appeared during boss fights when game was acting a big laggish and light sphere (the one serving as light source) dissapearing after you travel via crystal or die and a couple of sound effects missing (harvesting plants and logs underground, for instance), but that's not critical mostly. Performance & optimization is great overally and game runs smoothly on both powerful, mid-end and ""cozy"" specs like Mac Air (well, nothing surprising as it's not really resourceful).        _____________________________________________",True,False
"A masterpiece remastered and a sequel given similar treatment to keep you riding that high that X's story offered. I remember being quite surprised when they announced this and it happened just as i was thinking about another playthrough. Final Fantasy X acted as my first true introduction to JRPG's back in the day, borrowed from a friend i didn't expect to take to it like i did. The pre rendered cutscenes were amazing and i knew video games had taken the next step. Square Enix have done quite well in updating the textures here and making it look fresh for returning/new players. I must say that Tidus' face looks off to me though, it's almost as if i can't relate to him as much as compared to the original. Some sort of disconnect there, doesn't visually convey emotion as well IMO. I hear you can mod the game to make the faces look much better though. The gameplay is untouched in its fun brilliance, doesn't grow stale for me. Grinding is actually quite enjoyable, love making my characters stronger and better equipped. There's some challenging bosses in X/X-2 that require some strategy but grinding goes a long way. Can't beat a bit of turn based classical gameplay. X has a sweet progression/levelling system called the Sphere Grid. It's unique in the sense that you have more freedom in how you wanna progress your characters, the different types of spheres that you collect are for increasing their accompanying stats such as Health and Strength. Each character is initially geared towards a certain path such as being predominantly a magic user but you can make them quite well rounded eventually. I prefer this system to the conventional way of levelling, that will see you getting grouped stat increases instead. More thought can go in to how you wanna build your character. X-2 has the Dressphere System that has you changing outfits in and out of battle to give you different weapons and stats, this brings a level of strategy and is really fun. X's story will stay with you after you finish the game. It has touches of emotion and romance in the game, something i wasn't really exposed to at the time i first played it. You'll find yourself sucked in and start to care about the characters and overall have an amazing experience. X's soundtrack is top tier and really gets you immersed in the world of Spira, still listen to the soundtrack every now and again. X-2's story isn't as strong as X's but still has some great moments, the soundtrack is amazing and can still offer a really enjoyable experience. Overall this is a great package, you get a crazy amount of content for your money. Atleast 40-50hrs of playtime each and that's just the main story. You can easily double that if you do the secret bosses and get the celestial weapons etc. It is good to see the Americans get the previously missing content and now there's achievements :) Definitely worth the purchase in my eyes.

My favourite music game. Just play a fun shoot'em'up to flashy colours and effects to your own music while also score hunting. Still in Early Access so not quite finished content wise (custom ships and multiplayer are missing) but other than that better in every way than Beat Hazard 1.  Open Mic lets you use Youtube or Spotify for music sources which allows you to play to basically anything (even audio books if you want). Playing to other peoples song suggestions can also be fun with that. I don't blame you if you want to wait for custom ships and other stuff but it's really fun to play already. ,True,True

"The whole thing with the cats was super cute. Every now and then certain allusions or side stories really made me laugh! The combat system is really easy and quick to understand, and leveling itself is pretty easy, which makes the game progress quickly. If you proceed carefully and tactically, you can even create opponents 10 levels above you. I don't have much to say about the music except that it went well with the game and was quite varied. At some point you didn't have the feeling that you had to make out the annoying noises in the background, because it has adapted quite a bit. At least that's how I see it. Even after finishing the game once you can still discover and unlock a lot. Also challenging things like the ""Lvl 1 mode"", in which you have to complete the whole game in level 1. I am very curious to see whether I will be up to the challenges and I will definitely spend a few more hours on the game! In any case, I can recommend it very well if you don't mind cute animations or games and are also a big cat fan.

The new Okris challenges are just a joke too. 90% of them are just recognition chests. It's not as if I had hundreds of them. Otherwise the new add-on or DLC will bring more fun content.

"The game presents one of the most interesting arcades that I personally liked, I think the story will be better presented than in the anime. The downsides are, for sure, optimization during combat can get cut or the fps will drop quite low, cutscenes are classically stuck, and the rendering of the surroundings sometimes takes too long. The pros are definitely a dynamic fight where you spam your attacks, avoid enemy hits and at the same time give your orders. ",True,False

"Cleared, let’s briefly talk about my feelings. The first is the resource collection mechanism. It is too difficult to obtain resources in the early stage. It is difficult to obtain a large number of resources, but also requires a lot of resources. In the later stage, resources are not needed but resources are rolling in. The second is the combat mechanism, which can really be changed. This is the worst sandbox game I have played with the combat mechanism. Finally, the building. Why can't the whole house move together? Why wait for construction time? Why can't the brick house be moved even if it is empty? Okay, I’m done talking about it, let’s talk about the tips and tricks: 1. Keep calm in the battle. This is a game that is doomed to death if you can’t keep your breath. You must attract strangers one by one, try to attract strangers as little as possible, and don’t worry if you fight more Just eat food and medicine. If you have residual blood, you must hang up and wait for the blood to be full. You can use it when it is not disabled but you can do something. 2. Be careful in the early stage and try to use the terrain as a natural barrier, and only open up a path of exploration It’s fine, don’t dig in all three directions. If you can’t kill monsters and you are about to die, there is one trick you can use: Esc, save and exit, continue the game [You will be at the spawn point or mark ""Start the game from here"" And keep all other data, such as HP, loot, etc.] Okay, just like that, I’ll wait for the official update. If the update is good next time, the evaluation will not be changed. If it is not good, then Change the bad review, ah ",True,False

True, at the expense of screenshots in the store, in the game my graphics looked a little different, but as if through a Sharpen filter, and much darker, so that the girl is not visible in detail at all, and the monsters. It's great that the game has a full-fledged Russian language, with voice acting. In general, these comments are the funniest thing about the game, from which you get most of the fun.

"The storyline of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues the theme of the deadly struggle between the Florentine nobleman Ezio Auditore and the Knights Templar. New adventures of the Assassin will begin with the continuation of the second part of the game. The Templars do not intend to let go of Ezio's tricks and again seek to end him. However, Ezio is not the man to be afraid of the formidable order, the thirst for revenge for the murdered family drives them to visit the Templars' lair - Rome and frolic there wonderfully. To begin with, about the main thing: Brotherhood is a very high quality and exciting game. But objectively, this is just a tiny step both for the series as a whole and for the sequel to Assassin's Creed II in particular. The developers have fixed the bugs. Well, the main innovation was a fresh storyline and multiplayer, which is currently dead. It is unlikely that you will be able to get around all of Rome and its surroundings. The storyline and side quests can help you a little with this. To be honest, it was interesting for me to perform all the main tasks. There is no stupid give / fetch, you need to constantly choose the optimal path and put a lot of effort into achieving 100% synchronization. The city is divided into areas controlled by the papal army. In order to rid such an area of ​​the Borgia, you need to sneak into the forbidden zone near the towering tower and kill the captain of the guard, and then climb the tower and set it on fire. After that, you can buy real estate in the area and invest in various shops. In general, the economy plays an important role here and offers many ways to lighten your pockets. Firstly, new real estate is bought here, whether it be an ordinary stable in the suburbs or the famous Pantheon, and secondly, weapons, armor and Leonardo's improvements. Some weapons are awarded for collecting rare goods from chests and corpses of enemies, others are given for achievements, of which there are a great many. The music in the game is varied, very beautiful, perfectly complementing the visual range and creating an appropriate and subtle atmosphere. The graphics are all the same pleasing to the eye as in the previous parts. ",True,False

"Paladins - another Overwatch clone, or something new? The game Paladins was in the plans earlier than Overwatch, but came out later than Overwatch, for which it acquired the title of ""Overwatch clone"" And so - a very solid game similar to Overwatch, but with completely different heroes, ""ults"" and cards for heroes! With the help of cards, for example, you can add the number of arrows to the stock of weapons, increase the speed of health recovery, and much more! Also, the main advantage of the game falls on its availability, which is manifested by the free game. Pros: - Graphics - Free - Optimization - Variety Cons: - A small number of heroes (20 heroes are released on the review date) - No character elections during the ""skating"" (you cannot, for example, take and change Cassie to Androxus, etc. .) I really liked the game, and to support the developers, I bought the founder's kit (unlocks all the heroes)!

"I'M BACK TO REVIEWS BAYBEEEE ahem First off, this game is lying to you. The image says ""weeby-ass hentai game"" but that's only on the surface. If you like judging books by their covers, you probably didn't give this game a second look.  I somehow found my way to the review section and immediatley I saw a bunch of reviews saying that this game was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with me. I downloaded it, played it up until the part where  This game is deceitful, terrifying and smart. I highly recommend this game to everyone, mainly because it's just so gawd damn scary. It keeps you on your toes, because it never lets up. I should probably stop jerking this game off and actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review it. 1. Character Review All the characters in DDLC are well-crafted to be what they are shown to be. There's Yuri, this big tiddy goth chick who has social anxiety, which is relatable for me, and also likes knives (what?)  which you'll need to remember for later in the game. There's Sayori, the chick you've been friends with since childhood, who secretly has depression, which you'll also need to remember. Then theres Natsuki, who I don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ care about, but she's like a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying person who relentlessly talks ♥♥♥♥ to you. And then there's Monika, who is one of the most well-crafted and interesting characters in a video game i've ever seen, so ♥♥♥♥ off G-man. I'm not going to say anything about monika, because i would spoil the entire game. 2. The storyline The game follows some guy joining a literature club, which must be a japanese thing because wtf is a literature club. You write poems and have to choose which words fit the personalities of which girl. Yuri likes dark stuff, Natsuku likes cute stuff and Sayori's in the middle ground. Who you choose to write for determines who you end up dating, which pretty much guarantess 1 of 3 endings. But there's only Monika. 3. The endings. There are 3 endings to the game, which I got all of them. I'm going to spoil some now, so after sajust monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monikajust monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monikajust monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monikajust monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monikajust monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monikajust monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika just monika JUST MONIKA end ",True,False

"A couple of times I accidentally came across positive reviews and reviews of this game, but I didn't read it very much, I just put a tick in my mind that the toy is not bad and it would be possible to try it out whenever possible.

But after the launch, he could not resist and still looked what kind of fruit it was, for which he paid - he stuck in it for three hours. Damn, what an addictive toy. Everything in it is delightful: responsive controls, generated locations, a rich variety of flora and fauna, traps and equipment, there is a table of records in which it is interesting to compare my achievements with those of my friends, and I also have an untested multiplayer mode. The essence of the game is simple - to reach the exit, the subtleties in the nuances that are more interesting to comprehend yourself, so I will not describe this moment. In general, I highly recommend it to everyone. Indie games like Spelunky, The Binding of Isaac or FTL reintroduce the fashion to the generated levels and I'm glad about that.

"The city builder people deserve. Looking back, it has been a while since I've played a game like that, probably since Sim City 4. I've had Cities XL (no relation by the way) for a while but never tried it. C:S came out early in 2015 and won much praise from critics and gamers, probably still hurting over the lackluster SimCity. Having played this for 25 hours, I can say that it is exactly what people needed - big maps, a lot of systems to manage, tiered unlockable features for having a high amount of citizens and more. The game itself is very streamlined and should appeal to veterans and newcomers alike. I feel that developing a city isn't too hard (although I did screw up on my first attempt, leaving me with no cash) but should prove entertaining enough to keep going. While it is possible that at some point the city will be come mostly self-sufficient and you will not need to do much to maintain it other than expanding. In addition, the game has an extensive modding community, adding much needed variety to pretty much every section of the game. I know of at least one former Maxis developer who makes mods for this game. With this game and its expansions, look no further for a city management game. ",True,False
"This is a pretty interesting little game, with a few puzzles that might take you a bit of time to figure out if your don't look them up, a story that starts a bit cliche but then it introduces some peculiar characters and makes some decent ""plot twists"" as we find out more about the main character. Now I might be biased in this review as I have recieved this game for free, but if you have any doubts about it you can check my live, blind playthrough of it right here and hopefully it will help you make up your mind:   . There have been many games made in this style and it's very difficult to come with something new. While the gameplay or mechanics don't have anything innovative in them, I feel like the story is interesting enough to give it a shot. And it also has multiple endings, so you can do things differently than I did in the video and see where that leads you.

They even incorporated the game window into the game, moving the game in windowed mode moves the characters in the game. Slightly a short VN in comparison to others, story is well done but not the best, personally I believe the story could of been better. There is only one path in the game, but it doesn't effect the game's entertainment at all. When Vol 2 is made and released, I'm sure they'll incorporate more paths and possibly and even larger story. I will give this VN a 10/10 though, even though the story was slightly lacking, the VN's entertainment was top notch, and the animation is out of the world.

"HOI 4.5 is the best DLC released for Hoi4. The game is changing from top to bottom. Although it takes 10-15 minutes to get used to the chain of command situation, you are very relieved. The new scenarios look great, but for Oppose Hitler multi, it is very unreasonable. It drops it back, but it's perfect for those who want a different script. Romania and Bulgaria's puppet skills were very nice. The minimap is very nice. Focuses coming to the Asian area are excellent. Quest system can become very good with Turkey to establish Ottoman anymore. The game, especially enriched historically with its mission system. Political Power is now more important and harder to earn. Field marshals have very good effects. It's great to add talent to the generals. National Unity was removed and replaced by 'War Support' and 'Stability'. I think it was better because the NU was only dropped by atomic bombs, not anymore. For example, your Stability party increases according to the game. War support increases if you make a defense war and decreases if you make an attack war. You can increase your War Support with War Propaganda. Generals' badges have changed. In short, the game has almost changed from top to bottom, it has been an excellent DLC. It is the first decent DLC that is not just made like other DLCs. ",True,False

"Blitzkrieg 3 is, unfortunately, a disappointment in part for me. Even for such a low price, it is a product a bit inferior to previous games in the series. Overall, I can recommend this game, but it is necessary to turn a blind eye to a lot of shortcomings. First things first. The technical aspect of the game fails the most. With a Company of Heroes or even Men of War, the graphics look quite average. While the tanks or artillery look great, the infantry is at best made correctly (anyway, the whole graphic design looks actually worse than, for example, Codename Panzers: Cold War from 2009 ...). Blitzkriegi has never really impressed with graphics, so this aspect is not a big disadvantage for me. The real problem of the game is its terrible instability and problems with loading missions (and sometimes even the game itself has to be launched several times because it won't start the first time), saves, account verification, logging in - practically everything. It is also worth mentioning the random technical breaks (the game requires you to be online even in the single campaign). If you happen to have a break during the game, you'll get a crash, be kicked out of the game and lose your current mission progress (it's worth noting that there's nowhere to know when these service breaks start). With a high level of difficulty, the inability to properly load a save (which you can only have one for the entire game, and it loads correctly every four attempts) becomes really annoying. This artificially increased difficulty level (the enemy has much more durable units) can be seen in this example: my tank group (3 heavy and 3 medium) vs. 1 enemy medium tank - even when firing at it from different sides, usually the enemy still manages to take out 2-3 tanks. Recently, technical problems have occurred much less frequently, but I don't know how long this will last. It's good that the gameplay itself saves this game a lot - a large number of missions, tanks and armored vehicles that have been very accurately recreated and the pleasant gameplay itself are quite a lot of advantages. If nothing is crashing, the game is even fun (at least in the initial missions when the difficulty level is still not hurting or when you finally get it scouting + artillery = victory). As for me, the gameplay itself is even more pleasant than, for example, Company of Heroes, but it depends on specific preferences. To sum up: Pros: + A large range of missions in different areas + Three factions (USA / Great Britain, Russia, Germany) + A huge number of carefully recreated vehicles and tanks + Each unit is useful in different situations + Ability to use abandoned on the map and taken from the enemy cannons and howitzers + Lots of game modes (3 campaigns, defense of the base, assault on the base, skirmish with other players, skirmish with learning AI) Cons: - Terrible technical layer of the game: instability, crashes, frees, various bugs - Average graphics - Bent difficulty level in the further part of the campaign without the possibility of its adjustment - Only three factions - Necessity to be always online and terrible game servers - Possibility to have only 1 save # My rating: 7.0 / 10 ",True,False

"Even if you're not really into Shonen animus, as I am, KOF:Destiny is a decent and pretty good approach at making a cinematic animu of the beginning of the KOF's Universe. Let's grant you a quick review with no spoilers. Pros. ► Clean graphics and effects associated with a pretty decent physics engine and animation. ► Musics, OST, opening theme and ending theme are very good but feel a bit repetitive. ► Overall storyline. ► Characters. Animu full of fanboiz characters with some of them deal a pretty important role. Also nice to see new characters and futur characters. Don't forget this animu is based on KOF'94, so don't expect Robert to have a pronstash. ► Just the right dose of comedy. ► KOF XIV voice actors. ► Decently ported to Steam, except one episode where the subs were glitching out of the screen. ► It is free mah boiz. Neutrals. ► Some characters desgin. Some favorites have been really visually affected by the free will of the studio's desginers like Billy got now black undercut pony-tailed hair and a greasy belly. ► A pure Shonen from the start to the end. Some will absolutely love it but this animu go full Shonen 24/7 with the infamous good vs evil system, morality, characters development and cliché ending. Cons. ► Short episodes. With 3 min of opening, 5 min of ending and intros/outros that crush a whole 3 min, it can happen that the episode you're watching will actualy last around 7-8 minutes. Which sucks.  ► Time breaking storyline. 1994 with IPhones and face to face convo.  TL;DR. KOF Destiny is a pure Shonen meant for KOF and Shonen lovers. Despite having some flaws, the animu works pretty well considering the SNK budget. Had a fine time watching it. 70/100 ",True,False
"Earthmud palettes and lo-poly horror aesthetics dominate   dark reimagining of timeless classics such as the PS1's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Flipping the age old adage ""I have to return some videotapes[,]"" on its very head, Paratopic uses a decievingly simple task, such as delivering certain VHS tapes across the border, to belie a dark crawlspace of the Twilight Zone.  Against space, against coherence, against order; instead, in favor of its own, its unique, Paratopic lives up to its authentic modality by creating a feverish world to ""target an epitope[,]"" and fuel our body with a nightmarish liminality. An experience that, as Jungian psychology would describe it, first deconstructs in order to reconstruct, first breaks down in order to make whole. Paratopic is a process of disorientation. Multiple narratives, a backstory rendered unclear, fragmented shards of conversation and non linear scenes - all transform into an endless source of recreative power. Get lost and meander for a while in Jessica Harvey's unique passion. It will clear out your head, and maybe more. No save points. This is a fleeting experience made for one sitting. A space as infectious as it is healing. Explore a world not built for us, a world that hints it could spring a thousand more of its own monstrosity.

"This is one of the best sci-fi films I've seen in years.  There's no flashy graphics, alien invasions, or apocalyptic scenarios.  It doesn't spend a bunch of screen time ratcheting up false tensions, piling on mountains of expository dialogue, or following predictable movie tropes.  The ""hook"" is presented with an unapologetic lack of explanation.  The viewer is thrown into the chaos alongside the characters trying to piece it all together.  This is smart sci-fi and a great character-driven thriller.   Multiple viewings are encouraged and rewarded.  I've seen it several times and I've loved it more each time.  There are lots of little details that might be missed on a first viewing which have profound implication upon subsequent viewings, such as one character's quick glance at an object in the room or a line spoken off camera that is barely registered the first time around.  I won't ruin the plot in this review and suggest going into this film knowing as little as possible.  It's interesting piecing it all together and if you love it as I did, you'll want to watch it again and again to pick up on all the subtle details.  I had a bunch of ""oh sh-t!"" moments on my third viewing once I started paying really close attention. The way it was filmed is also really interesting.  This is an indie film with a $50k budget shot on Canon 5D's.  It was filmed at the director's own house over the course of 5 nights with only pair of cameras, a skeleton crew, and completely natural lighting.  The most interesting thing is that the acting is entirely improv.  The actors had no scripts.  They didn't know the story ahead of time.  It was filmed like a mystery dinner party, with the actors staying in-character, and the director as master of ceremonies pulling strings behind the curtain.  Before each scene the actors received a small sheet of notes directing them as to what their character should accomplish.  He left it in the actors' hands to craft the scene, only pausing to ""right the ship"" when they started veering too far off course.  What we get from this are natural conversations and genuine characters while the actors work together to craft a coherent story.  They're figuring it all out as they go, just like the audience.  It's a fun way to create a film, certainly too risky in the big-budget space, but it really works here to create a compelling, refreshing experience. I have a couple gripes with the Steam version.  It appears this film is only currently available at a maximum of 544p resolution.  The store page suggests 720p and proper 1080p options are available, as listed in the recommended system requirements, but these options were not present at my time of viewing.  I've also viewed this film on Amazon Prime Video and it has a 1080p option, so it shouldn't be a matter of availability of a ""full HD"" version. Also, some scenes are particularly dark due to filming outdoors at night and using only natural lighting sources.  Due to the low-light conditions and digital compression there are occasionally color banding and artifacting issues.  Despite these technical issues, this is one of my favorite indie films of all time and I look forward to see more from this director in the future. ",True,False

In Ryse: Son of Rome, the Roman soldier Marius is accompanied by an interesting, if not complex, revenge story at the time of Emperor Nero. The young soldier loses his family in an attack by British barbarians on Rome. In search of revenge, he joins the Legion that is sent to Britain to put down the rebellion there. Over time, he finds out that it wasn't the British who were behind the murder of his family, and he returns to Rome to kill the real culprits. The main focus is on the elaborately staged cutscenes, the very realistic graphics and the brutal combat system. The plot is mostly driven forward in cinematic and epic cutscenes. The levels are linear and mostly only serve to get from one fight to the next, because the core lies in the combat system. This can be learned quickly, but offers little variety. Marius can strike with a sword or shield and block or dodge attacks. For some opponents a special procedure is required, for example, enemies with a shield must first be unbalanced by a blow of their own, before they can be injured with the sword. Such simple schemes are well known to experienced players. Mainly you hit the opponent alternately with the sword or the shield, which, with good timing, builds up a series of hits. If opponents have been processed long enough, a skull symbol above them indicates that they can now be killed with a finishing move called ""execution"". + Story about ancient Rome + mostly fantastic & varied splendid backdrops + great modeled faces / figures + four types of rewards in the combat system + entertaining co-op mode + very good controls + collectable items + Achievements and trading cards - short Story - Fellow campaigners - AI acts far too passively or stupidly - Keyboard layout cannot be adjusted Ryse: Son of Rome offers you an entertaining action spectacle without playful depth. The story looks realistic and was staged ready for the cinema, which I personally liked very much. Ryse: Son of Rome ist ein Action-Abenteuer/Hack and Slay Spiel, welches von Crytek entwickelt wurde.  In Ryse: Son of Rome wird der römische Soldat Marius zu Zeiten von Kaiser Nero durch eine interessante, wenn auch nicht komplexe, Rachegeschichte begleitet. Der junge Soldat verliert bei einem Angriff britischer Barbaren auf Rom seine Familie. Auf der Suche nach Rache schließt er sich der Legion an, die nach Britannien entsendet wird, um dort den Aufstand niederzuschlagen. Mit der Zeit findet er heraus, dass es nicht die Briten waren, die hinter der Ermordung seiner Familie stecken und er kehrt nach Rom zurück, um dort die wahren Schuldigen zu töten. Im Vordergrund stehen dabei vor allem aufwendig inszenierte Zwischensequenzen, die sehr realistische Grafik sowie das brutale Kampfsystem. Die Handlung wird meist in cineastischen und episch inszenierten Zwischensequenzen vorangetrieben. Die Level sind linear und dienen meist nur dazu, um von einem Kampf zum nächsten zu gelangen, denn der Kern liegt im Kampfsystem. Dieses lässt sich schnell erlernen, bietet aber wenig Abwechslung. Marius kann mit Schwert oder Schild zuschlagen und Angriffe blocken oder diesen ausweichen. Für manche Gegner wird eine spezielle Vorgehensweise benötigt, so müssen Feinde mit einem Schild durch einen eigenen Schildschlag zuerst aus dem Gleichgewicht gebracht werden, ehe sie mit dem Schwert verletzt werden können. Solche simplen Schemata sind erfahrenen Spieler_innen durchaus bekannt. Hauptsächlich schlägt man also abwechselnd mit dem Schwert oder dem Schild auf die Gegner ein, wodurch sich bei gutem Timing eine Trefferserie aufbaut. Wurden Gegner lange genug bearbeitet, zeigt ein Totenschädel-Symbol über ihnen an, dass sie nun mit einem ""Hinrichtung"" genannten Finishing-Move getötet werden können. +Geschichte über das alte Rom + überwiegend fantastische & abwechslungsreiche Pracht-Kulissen + großartig modellierte Gesichter / Figuren + vier Belohnungsarten im Kampfsystem + unterhaltsamer Koop Modus + sehr gute Steuerung + sammelbare Gegenstände + Errungenschaften und Trading Cards - kurze Geschichte - Mitstreiter- KI agiert viel zu passiv bzw. dumm - Tastaturbelegung lässt sich nicht anpassen Ryse: Son of Rome bietet dir ein Kurzweiliges Action-Spektakel ohne spielerische Tiefe.

"Bias: I am a dinosaur. Usually I would destory building not protect them. I would say this game has a lot of potential. It is a simple tower defense with shooter component to it. There are 3 levels with 7 waves in each level. Map gets smaller with progression. If this game is continued to be worked on, I can see more levels easily added and different monsters. Currently, only green slimes are attacking your tower, and depending on the gun you are able to afford.  I will say that the base gun is a bit clunky. You can only shoot in 1 of the 8 cardinal directions, so when trying to aim with a free flowing mouse, the shots do not go where you aim. In addition, the shop after each wave, in my opinion block potential tower space, since you can place a tower in the are, and so that side, for me always felt weaker. I would also say the price of object compared to the drop of coins are a bit off as well. I would give this game an 7/10.

"Hardly anyone does not know this legend. They are a legend that is very enjoyable in every aspect. At the time, 3 games were played in internet cafes. Age Of Empires, Ultima Online, and Worms. It is one of those rare games where officially time does not work. Especially if you are playing with your friends, do not say you vote, vote, vote for your pleasure. It is a game that I don't do a little reel, definitely try it ^^ It is one of the best games I have played in my life. Worms is the year 2018 and I hope 2028 is a game that I can play without getting tired. Since I started with World Party, I still continue with it. It has a special place for me. Especially the moment I saw it on Steam and the moment I bought it, officially my hand did not go to close the page, I love it so much before I buy it. Oh whatever. However, I have been playing for so many years and when I first played, I do not curse at the moment that the wolves played by the computer use bazooka and grenades like poison. Can't a man make a clumsy pinpoint at once? While praying that he will not die in the most unlikely places, when he does not die, while thinking about the wonderful plans that the next tour regiment will clog his life, but what is that, don't you have a bazooka or grenades with a perfect shot on your head? At that moment, all your plans die off like an anchor that has fallen into water. On the contrary, sometimes it is invaluable when he does a very good job and sends more than one worm to the Donkey Heaven with filthy laughter. Only wolves, who can use such perfect weapons, can do very absurd and funny clumsiness when necessary. My favorite weapons are banana, flamethrower, minigun, shotgun and of course super sheep. Look, we almost forgot the baseball bat. In the past, when they got sick, they coughed very badly, ""epçi epçi"". In the new Steam version, they removed it, it was not nice to me that they did not actually uninstall but update. Recently, Worms had a crisis, and while I was saying let me see the cousins, it was also very enjoyable to play with the voice of the deceased Kemal Sunal of the maggots. Play it is a great game.

"AI: The Somnium Files is a visual novel/adventure game where a serial killing is taking place and you are tasked with unraveling the mystery as to who the killer is, what the connections are, and why they are taking the victim's eyes. Kind of similar to previous Uchikoshi works, the game branches out to different timelines based on what choices you make and you will learn different key information at each timeline. Some of which changes things that you already know in dramatic ways, which leads to a thrilling and satisfying conclusion. The characters are the stars of the show. Date, Aiba, Boss, Iris, Ota, Mizuki, even minor characters are all well-written and fleshed out, with the characters' motives driving their actions based on the choices you make. The action scenes in the game do tend to drag on and break the pace of the game, but on the other hand the somnium sections where you explore each character's dreams are memorable and each somnium is distinct and personifies their character really well. The logic do sometimes feel like you're banging two rocks together to shoot for the moon, but dreams don't always really make sense anyway, and the game is pretty forgiving with hints, help and retries.

"A huge, beautiful, brutal platformer with blinding polish and a difference in philosophy: it wants you to beat everything it's got, because you can do anything. That's what the story's about, that's what the game itself is about -- channeling all the fractured, doubting parts of oneself, compressing the dissociated, gaseous will into a beam of hot plasma that can burn through the barrier of the impossible and open a tunnel to the golden land of victory. Celeste's message is empowerment through sweat, and the change that comes over us when we embrace, rather than evade, the difficulties of life. This is a game that's worth hundred-percenting. I did it without ever activating assist mode, and though I died nearly 9,000 times, I never once felt I couldn't conquer an obstacle. Even a string of 500 deaths in a row could not shake my confidence and drop me into a rut of nervous failure, and I owe that to the game's uniquely uplifting atmosphere. It would not surprise me if playing Celeste pulled some people out of depression.  If you play 2D action games at all, this is an essential addition to your Steam library.  (Changing Madeline's hair color to show how many midair dashes she has left is a brilliant idea!

However the game still manages through the audio for you in an atmosphere of terror, even if small but it can. This game tries to adjust you more with unpredictable things in the scenario than with the story itself, because it is quite flawed and many times the person gets lost and does not understand what is happening. However bizarrises help to keep the atmosphere of something abnormal and strange.

"Truck Simulator is a very specific genre. A modern player is unlikely to want to play a game where there is nothing but driving from city to city ... To understand what is interesting on such trips, you need to catch the time of the game-founder of this genre - Truckers 2. This was the very first game about truckers ( the first part is truck racing, there is nothing special ...), i.e. the game made it possible to get behind the wheel of a truck, take the cargo and deliver it to its destination along any available path. And that would be boring. if there were no police (the traffic rules system was implemented), the mafia, tuning, the possibility of creating your own company, exploring the world (isn't it a lot for the first game of the genre?) and ... the ARIA group. Over time, ""18 Wheels of Steel"" appeared. It evolved from the Hard Truck series, which is a foreign name for Truckers (Truckers and Truckers 2 were called Hard Truck and Hard Truck 2, respectively), and the first 18 Steel Wheels were called Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel "". This is one of the first projects of SCS Software where they implemented an open world. And now, after such a ""small"" introduction, I turn to Euro Truck Simulator 2 - at the moment, the best Truck Simulator! And where is he the best? In fact, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the same 18 Wheels of Steel, only in Europe, but the differences lie in the details: 1.Physics. ETS 2 is probably the most realistic physics model, as the car does not behave ""correctly"" in any other game. 2.Europe. Or rather - ""World Map"". SHE IS GREAT! Of course, it is reduced 3 times from real Europe, but it is clearly not felt small. And I would not write it differently, but besides the size from other Simulators, it differs in Variety. Not a variety of roads, of course, you will meet the same junctions, tunnels and types of ""road repair"" quite often. I'm talking about landscapes, they are beautiful and unique for each section of the road and the country in particular. 3. Traffic. ETS 2 implements the most realistic AI behavior possible for games of this genre. I will not go into details, but one thing I can say for sure - AI cars can go at different speeds on the highway, and this is a rarity for games, not only of this genre, but also others ... 4. Living World. Well, how alive ... while traveling you can often see how on the railway. a high-speed train is passing through the bridge, wind farms are working, farmers are working in the fields, and an airplane is landing / taking off at the airport, etc. You can also see pedestrians on the road, but this is a rare phenomenon ... 5. The ability to listen to the Radio. Not in-game radio, like in Truckers 3, but real radio. Initially, various foreign radio stations are already thrown in there, but if you wish, you can drop your list there and listen to, for example, Chanson during the trip (I prefer to turn on radio stations with European music.). The ability to listen to a regular playlist is also available .. 6. Rain. Before ETS 2 came out, the best rain was in (you will be surprised) Truckers 2! In ETS 2, rain is made much better (and prettier), each cable behaves like it does in real life (well ... close to that). In addition to these advantages, you can find others in ETS 2, but now I'll tell you about the disadvantages, if it's important to someone ... The first disadvantage is the lack of an external damage system. The truck body, engine, wheels, etc. may be damaged, but this will not be displayed externally. however, you will immediately notice the difference in handling an intact and broken tractor. The second is the number and type of trucks. In ETS 2, there is only one type of truck - a tractor, and there are 8-10 trucks in total and all without hoods ... fortunately, all car brands are licensed. The third drawback - as already mentioned at the very beginning, genre. However, I will still explain what ""Truck Driver Simulator"" means to me. These are games in which the main goal for me is not to deliver the cargo, but to enjoy the ""romance of the road"", completely relax and drive along the highway from Berlin to Paris, from London to Aberdeen to the music of the road (Yes, the UK is also here, with left-hand traffic and signs in miles). Just go, with a load, without - it doesn't matter ... Pass by interesting places, watch those who are also going somewhere ... Score ... Interstellar / 10 ",True,False
"A quick puzzle adventure in a surreal (sometimes gory) world that enforces outside-of-the-box thinking. The style alone is a dead give-away that the game is a Justin Roiland brainchild, so if you're a fan of Rick and Morty, you'll love this. Even if you don't watch Rick and Morty, I think you'll appreciate this game for its meta adult humor, outlandish level designs and odd cartoonish style. Think of this as a fun demo for Accounting+, and a great try-out game if you're just starting out in VR and don't want to drop money yet on a full-length title until you've gotten your feet wet in VR gaming. What is especially nice about this little game is that it is room-scaled and as such practically eliminates any motion sickness that VR might give you -- everything is within reach of wherever you're standing, and the physics are very polished. This was ideal for me back when I first tried VR and found games that required teleportation or that moved you around a lot to be confusing and nauseating.  All in all, it's a free VR title, it's funny, it's surreal, what's there not to like about it? There's a tiny amount of gore, so if you're squeamish or very young maybe you shouldn't play this, but it's only in one level and you can see hints of it in the screenshots that Steam provides.

Yes, I agree, it's stupid but cool.

"With a complete experience, I'm about to make a review for remarkably designed and developed, Singularity from Raven Software. I completed it once near 2014 or something, and I had tremendous experience back then. Now after half a decade, I completed it once again and it was better than ever. Now let me tell you how it was. Singularity is driven out with a very unparalleled and unpredictable story-line. It unbolts a verily chaotic, yet interesting story of Nathaniel Renko and takes place on an island called Katorga-12, based on dark and haunting theme. Singularity is a terrifying incident that happens on that island and the whole story is kinda based on time manipulation or you can say time-travelling as it goes through different timelines and flashbacks. You're about to discover some unimaginable force of time manipulation and becoming a part of mysterious history that no one ever knows. I kinda had a blast on my mind at the end of the story, like when I figured out everything. So, you might want to have it as well. Gameplay is secondly the most engaging thing about Singularity after it's tragic story. I would say, it's gameplay is a compound of BioShock, Doom, Dead Space, F.E.A.R at once. But still, it has it's own way to deliver a fine experience to us. As I said, the story is based on dark, haunting theme, which is why the world design and gameplay are prior to that. You'll face countless radiated and infected hostiles in every step you take in Katorga-12. But for them, you've got couple of destructive weapons, strategic opportunities around the world, and most importantly the TMD (Time-Manipulation Device) which is unarguably the heart of Singularity. With TMD, you can travel through different timelines, control the gravity. age up or down enemies, degrade or renew objects and many more features. So this is what makes Singularity remarkably thrilling and engaging. Visuals aren't so appealing as it is from 2010, but still considerably fine. Same goes for character mechanisms, facial movements and texture works. But the world design is impressive enough to deliver a phenomenally atmospheric experience. Singularity delivers a phenomenal story-line with unpredictable plots, gameplay with lots of features and intact mechanisms. The story is strong enough to get you stunned at the very end, while the gameplay is full of fine features and dark-atmospheric theme. So, jump into it and have the unimaginable force of TMD to travel through multiple timelines and reach the mystery within Singularity. So guys, here's my complete review for Singularity and I'll be adding more details with it. For now, I assure you that you're gonna have an epic, thrilling run-over as well. ",True,False

"A very good game, fun, energetic, versatile gameplay, but the rocket league has too many drawbacks, in the absence of which the game would be perfect. 1.Very bad transition from Steam to EG (Epic Games). Not only do many people dislike EG as a game store and launcher for numerous reasons (myself included), EG decided to make it mandatory to link EG's account, even if you have a game in incentive. 2. And again, the great EG servers cannot withstand the influx of fortnighters and freebies. As a result, we get: an awfully long search for games, unstable ping in games on many servers, bugs with entering tournaments, packet losses with perfect internet. 3. A large number of bugs happened in trades that the smoked psyonix can no longer fix for more than 4 days. For example, how do you scam with taking your things through a bug with trade cancellation? Well, yes, this is calonyx, we hear, but we blind. 4. Even more toxic games and suffering. Fortnite schoolgirls came to the free competitive game. Yes, I'm dead. But, in general, if you are a veteran of the game, then you can chew the Epic Gays rocket servers through the simplicity. ",True,False

"8 hours of gameplay time have passed, the game is completed, a review should be written. Ryse is a game that is one that is highly memorable for its plot. This is such a full-length and very long film in which you are directly involved. I believe that this game fully describes the events of that time: conspiracies, the insidiousness of the authorities, and, of course, an integral part of the war. Specifically here is Gallo-Roman. Quite an impressive part of the game is devoted to well-designed cut-scenes, which is why the game is called a ""game-film"". Smoothly from this you can move on to the pluses: Graphics: here, in fact, there are two sides of the coin: it seems that 2014 and the game was transferred from the Xbox, but at the same time Crytek was engaged in the game (who made Crysis, for a minute). I will say this: all markers are different in taste and color, but, as for me, the game is very beautiful. Plot: let me remind you that for me this is a film and I can say that the plot is 9/10, as I would give, for example, to ""Gladiator"" The elaboration of cut-scenes: what amazed me and, yes, and, I think, not only. Facial expressions, emotions ... There is something in this And, of course, there are no drawbacks: Boevka (or the fashionable name QTE): she's boring, it's true. All battles, whether they are bosses or ordinary enemies, are reduced to the same blows with a sword and shield and dodges, and it all ends with an execution (at the same time, I note that I do not attribute executions to minuses, since there are quite a few of them and they are quite diverse). I said above about executions, but this is part of both executions and combatants. Meat and blood is what was lacking in that game. Yes, there is amputation of limbs, but it is not very realistic and blood is generally useless. The game is about the brutal battles of the Romans and the Gauls-barbarians, and this is an integral part of them, in my opinion. Yes, the game would have a higher age limit, but the mechanics of executions and fights would be more beautiful. What can be said in general? It's a worthwhile game, the price is even ridiculous. For standard ~ 8 hours of gameplay, you will get unrealistic sensations and emotions, I advise. ",True,False

"So, again, the evil aliens itch, once again our unfortunate planet is attacked by foreign invaders. Cities are destroyed, sheer chaos, the apocalypse has actually come. In the role of a certain major, without explaining the essence of the matter, they are thrown into the very heat of the battle with the adversaries, entrusting under our control something similar to the next nth modification-modernization of the famous T-72. It smiled a little that the action seems to be taking place somewhere across the Atlantic, and our tank is too obviously ""not from there"" - this is evidenced not even by the prototype tank, but by the default coloring with the tricolor, bear and Kalash. Our tank is armed with classic shells (well, it's a tank!), A heavy gatling machine gun, a rocket launcher and a flamethrower. Rides briskly, knows how to accelerate and ""jump"" on trampolines. The invaders, at the first glance, cause a persistent déjà vu - the author was clearly inspired by the Mass Effect series, Half-Life and War of the Worlds. The very first boss with his limbs and a ray cannon immediately reminded the Destroyer from Mass Effect. Some mobs resemble the Hunters from HL2EP2, and the long-lived ""half-bosses"" are somewhat reminiscent of the eliens from the ""War of the Worlds"" and the Striders from the same HL2. Our task is to cope with the waves of respawning eliens of all stripes, simultaneously capturing control points - ""bases"" of aliens, while keeping within the allotted time. For the destruction of adversaries and the capture of points, bonuses fall out - health (apparently the armor of the tank), a shield or a combat assistant drone, which for some reason shoots only at small units and shows exceptional indifference to larger carcasses. Dynamic but somewhat annoying. After fifteen waves - the continuation of the same occupation - exterminate-eat-seize - my jaw began to shake with a yawn. After each wave, I thought - well, when will the fucking boss and this all finally end and there will be the next level? Too much and monotonous, it can quickly get bored and boring. To the noticed shortcomings, I will also attribute the absolutely silent operation of the flamethrower (here it is not felt at all!) And the fact that the physics of the shot (the twitching barrel) works only when the tank is moving, and if you are sealed somewhere and shoot shells in motionlessness, the shells simply fly out , without any shot animation (barrel / turret bouncing). In general, the game is similar to a slasher, only instead of a character wielding a blade, we have a multi-ton iron colossus, which, despite its heavy weight, jumps and flies sharply when colliding with opponents. Obviously, if the author does not abandon the project, but really refines it, as promises in the description, a very worthy product can turn out. Nevertheless, and at the moment the game deserves attention at least as an arcade shooter-time killer. Dynamic, with an eye-catching picture, with a perfectly controlled tank and frail, but annoying aliens and quite epic bosses. In general, the game deserved its adequate price. And, I think, I will not mind to drive her some other evening after a hard working day =) ",True,False

"If you have already crossed the thirty-year milestone (or are just approaching it), consider yourself a serious gamer, keeping in your soul fond memories of the first playthroughs of Half Life and Diablo, and recently even passed the Bloodborne speedrun for forty minutes, then it is quite possible that you absolutely absolutely the Kitty Powers' Matchmaker dating simulator is missing in life. In the trailer, the game's mascot is affectionately looking at us - Kitty Powers herself, that is, a huge guy in a pink dress and vintage glasses, who is also a game developer. - Kittens, - she says, - it is so difficult to find love ... But you will help all these lonely hearts from my little notebook to find true love? And here it is - the beginning of a romantic adventure, an exciting casual game with an excellent sense of humor, which was even labeled ""horror"" by some hilarious fellow on Steam. To begin with, you are allowed to choose the appearance of your avatar and pass a psychological test (not MMPI, without panic, rather like in a glossy magazine), because the avatar will be able to find love himself in the future (though already in the games of friends). Starting with the status of ""nobody"", as an errand boy with a matchmaker, one day you will fly out from under the wing of a big mom and go off to build love on your own in your agency. But this is very far away, for a start you have to do the joy of the voyeur - poke around the cameras in the restaurant that the client has chosen, and help him not to make a mistake through the earpiece. And in the skill of disgracing yourself, your wards will not be equal. Have you chosen a diner for a date with a demanding beauty? Ordered a vegan hot dog? He blurted out that you think horoscopes are bullshit (What ?! But what about ""Pluto-in-scorpio-in-the-fifth-house-and-we-are-destined-to-always-be-together"")? Decided to have a smooth shave before the date, and she suddenly likes bearded hipsters ... And to top it off publicly, because he lost the card mini-game? In short, the fact that you were thrown into the trash can, and literally, was expected. It's all your fart, Karl! This will not lead to good. But not everything is so bad. There are also those who fall in love at first sight; find out that they are passionate about the same hobbies, find the disgusting bad habits of the companion charming and, right by Exupery, look in one direction already on the first date. And then letters about the fourth child in the last six months will pour in (and where do they get them from? ""Robert, Robert, the seed is strong ...""). After such happy endings, you are entitled to a decent portion of tips that you can use to upgrade your salon. For example, order the services of a stylist to repaint a potential bride blonde, as the pretentious groom ""ordered"". Or buy access to high-end restaurants where you are not ashamed to bring your fastidious partner. Speaking of partners. Same-sex relationships are possible in the game, so you can safely be touched by smacking lesbians. However, if ""godless homogeys"" appear to you at every step, there is a magic button ""kick out"". And now, in place of the glamorous comrade who was looking for a blue-eyed blond, a brutal bus driver came with a dream of a brown-eyed doe who would give him a dozen children. In general, Kitty Powers' Matchmaker turned out to be cartoonish, deliberately stupid and very funny. Usually such kazualki quickly get bored, but this one boldly pleases with its kind fun for more than a dozen hours. Achievements are fascinating: for example, lying about yourself already 4 times and still go under the arm to the altar, or falling in love with each other incompatible geek and glamorous girl. The only stumbling block that has already become expected is the lack of the Russian language in the game. But the most tsimes is there in the dialogues, which will have to be read carefully, because everyone speaks something like Simlish by ear. Do you know the ritual of eating the French delicacy of the songbird-oatmeal, overgrown with a bunch of legends? Need to drown her in brandy alive, fry and eat savory, covering her head with a huge white napkin in order to bashfully hide against the all-seeing eye of God? So, Kitty Powers' Matchmaker should be played about the same. Experiencing the famous ""guilty pleasure"", start this pink madness, while everyone is playing GTA V, and marry, marry, marry pixelated people lost in life to the tunnel syndrome in the wrist. And then the cheeks will ache habitually, because it is absolutely impossible not to smile at this nightmare. specially for VGblogs.ru ",True,False
"Anyway... I am only a few minutes into this game and oh jesus is it difficult. Super Hexagon is about moving a triangle in the center of the map, where your goal is to keep moving for as long as you can without hitting any of the colored lines. These lines vary in color and eventually get to the most ridiculous patterns that prove a challenge in dodging! For Gameplay all you really do is use the arrow keys to move the triangle around. Remember, you need fast reflexes, as one screw up will make it to where you won't have enough time to dodge the line, causing you to restart the WHOLE thing. I think a few of you at this point are really sad after getting close to beating Hexagonist. Speaking of Hexagonist... When you reach a certain time limit in a particular difficulty, you will unlock another difficulty that is more challenging. The higher the difficulty is, the more lines are on screen and their speed is upped! As for graphics, there is almost no good way to describe them. Trippy! That's for sure, the colors are constantly changing like its a rainbow! Final Review: This game can be worth it if you like a good challenge, this game will test your reflexes to the speed and variations of line patterns! However, if your someone who is a hothead (or anybody who gets pissed off real easily) then I  don't recommend you buy this, because YOU WILL have a bad time, trust me. ",True,False

The game feels a bit like a cross between runescape and maplestory, but with a more retro feel to it. Sometimes theres a bit of lag, but for the most part its bareable Favorite part about this game right now is the community, The developers are super active, and generaly take interest in players opinions and ideas about how to better the game. Although if your rude don't expect much love. There's no Pay to win, either. There is nothing you can buy for Money, thats going to make you more prepared for end game content. It can however make early game a Tad bit easier to buy a mount with good hp. However around level 45 your able to grind for one of the Highest HP mounts in the game.

Amicia and Hugo arrive at Laurentius' farm, who was looking for a cure for Hugo's illness together with his mother. There they also find Lucas, the doctor's apprentice. Lucas explains that Hugo's blood carries an evil called Prima Macula. His mother and Laurentius were trying to find a cure for Hugo, while the Grand Inquisitor, Vitalis Benevent, coveted his power. A Plague Tale: Innocence is a game for those who like historical surroundings. It has pieces of puzzle, action and stealth. The approach to the story and the characters is dramatic and exciting. The mechanics of mice and light are unique and fun. I recommend it to anyone who likes strong games in stories to revisit reimagined historical periods. ",True,False

"Best VR rogue-like experience with some Darksouls feeling and surpringly some Diablo feeling (especially the pits and the first Boss). Best VR Archer mechanics and crossbow (which is easier) Basically, there are two levels, which are always a bit different, but overall identical, with a boss fight at the end. You only have a bow or a crossbow and a shield. Teleport arrows and teleport shards work very well, free locomotion is an option. You can find/buy/unlock special arrows later on. Difficulty/progress is linked to an achievement system, where each achievement unlocks a helpful bonus or new enemys (only level 1 enemys in demo mode [available in settings while in sanctuary] good for showcasing the game to friends). Quite challenging, no doubt, and the first VR game which i would describe terrifying to some degree (those pits can really get your heart beating) but a really great VR title, how it should be!

"A very colorful and interesting game, with pumped-over game mechanics, beautiful and lively San Francisco, an interesting plot, but with rather bad physics of weapons. In general, I liked the game, it left me a lot of impressions. I recommend buying. ",True,False
"The game is green (I hope that the overvaluation of the fanyoutubers does not leave the game without updating by the devs since it shows that it is a beta). Description: You are a ghostbuster, not like the ""bums"" that appear on certain American television shows hitting voices and stuff. You are rather an Iker Jimenez with professional equipment to rob houses in a gypsy van and whose objective is to catch clues to earn a salary that you do not even buy used socks in a rake. But even so, you go and play it like a champion against entities that leave liquid diarrhea in the toilets (which you must take a picture of) or see how the table flickers like a techno disco in full swing and incidentally if you can grab some bottles of wine from the houses that you profane to put them in the van and thus hit a night of party party with the ghosts you can also do it if the party is going. (it was joke, I have dedicated myself to stealing drinks, phones and dishes from places I visit) ------------------------------------ Leaving the joke aside ------- ----------------------- Personally it is a ""super overrated"" game since the ""youtubers"" consider this as a cult horror game, when it's not even close to the heels of amnesia / penumbra 2 (I've played worse games on itch.io). But despite this, it is a piece of an investigation game, that is, finding the clues and identifying the type of ghost it is (if you like investigation games, it can be a really potential one due to the randomness concept that prevails over it.) The bad: -It is not far from a horror game, at least I personally do not consider it that way (perhaps in future updates it will be) since currently the few games that I have played with friends have only been brief chases while you hear footsteps behind and the ghost catches you (penumbra 2 / amnesia offer a better horror system). -The optimization of the game is horrible no matter what pc you have, a game that only loads a 3D building with 4 or 5 rooms (or 20 if you take the school) should not cause so many stops. I have played Doom Eternal / Monster Hunter World on this pc and have had no problems with them. -It has certain bugs that fail to identify the ghosts (sometimes the tracks do not appear or some element does not work correctly) so in the end you will use the discard to identify what type of ghost it is. The good: -It is a good game to troll your colleagues especially by putting your voice as soon as a new update comes out to strain them like (my voice is an update). -The best and its potential is based on finding the ghost and identifying it since it gives it the puzzle / investigation touch that many people like me love. -The randomness concept (although it is reduced personally) gives it a replayable touch with friends or alone. IMPORTANT: I ​​hope that in future updates they will add more places, objects, ghosts, types of ghosts to make it much more replayable and above all to improve the horror scenes (not male, it does not scare me and to prove it I put it here below with a video of mine super lageados by bad optimization). PS: kidding, what do people see scared of school? Guiris players connected to my game and left saying ""no high school no please"", it's not so bad: S ",True,True

"I got this during a sale for 75% off. Whether or not the purchaser is a DAW user, I feel is aside from the point of the value of this app. Benefits of practicing rhythms (as a general musician) using this app I'd say would include stimulating your visual memory as well as your ears as you can watch and listen to what you play at the same time. I don't feel it's fair to say this program is equivalent to any VST despite the quality of said vST because a VST is only offering a simulation of the aural experience which doesn't include the visual side of things. I recommend this if it happens to be on sale at the time. The regular price of $20 feels to be much too hefty in my eyes for an app such as this unless additional features continue to be added. Again, this is just my personal opinion on the matter. Browse other reviews before making your decision if you're still uncertain. EDIT: I would say, with the workshop functionality which I've now taken the time to experience, I'd have paid even 10$ or a bit more for this product if it was 50% off instead of 75% off. Again, it is a quite enjoyable experience and I've been using it often so full price may definitely be worth it to you.

"So how to start this The Resident Evil saga was one of the most important ones in my childhood, i grew to became a huge fan of the franchise, resident evil 3 was my favorite of all the resident evils i played but this remake is kinda lackluster I dont know if i was blinded by nostaligia or not, i loved the game play i love to re imagine and relive classic moments from this story but the game has many things holding it back: my main issues being: A LOT of cut content leading to a very small campaing able to beat it in 5 hours on hardcore Little to low replay ability ... one suggestion i would have for this would be after completing the first campaing make the next gameplay diffrent changing the style motations of nemesis or even hading some that were cute from the classic A anti climax ending  Lack luster puzzeles with the only one really pushing through me was the reprograming of the metro route  Too much action in favor of the survival horror gameplay style even in harcore the ammount of health cure and ammo is very abundant and almost all combat being foccused around the new weird dash mechanic that makes the game easy, also there are too many actions scenes making them less and less impactful each time they take place and the only real creative boss fight was the last one with all of the rest being the typical bullet sponge and lastly is the past of the game, its the fattest thing i have ever seen, the charcter introduction feels cheap and rushed instead of being builded up like it should overall its a good game, it serves to complement the story of resident evil 2 in a diffrent prespective yet bigger scale, i think the game price should be lowerd a bit its not worth a triple h price tag on it,  i dont know if im judging it through the glasses of nostalgia but despite everything i enjoyed the gameplay, nemesis is the most interactive enemy that i have ever seen in any video game this day, the npc intellegence is amazing in this game and that keeps you on your toes, the aesthetic and art of this game is also incredible the gameplay despite minimal problems its smooth. i wish the game had more content that missed out from the original , harder puzzles, less action and more survival horror, harder to find supplies and slower paste, i hope capcom learns with their mistakes but also take pride in their victories, im just not sure if this is one of them final rate: 8/10 despite being my fav re from all time ",True,False
"Frederic: Resurrection of Music Director's Cut is a game that offers a rather curious tribute to the legacy of Frédéric Chopin, who is considered one of the greatest representatives of musical romanticism. Basically the game has the same mechanics as Guitar Hero but not with a guitar but with a piano; The game presents a pretty crazy story and is told as if it were a comic, things get interesting after Chopin's resurrection at the hands of muses who entrust him with an honorable mission to face the scourge of modern music. Chopin must face various musical genres and styles, ranging from hip-hop, techno, Indian music, reggae, and even anime music (an otaku challenges you to death after making a joke about his waifu), the story it's pretty funny with an interesting turn of events at the end. I think the gameplay could be improved a lot, since the controls are difficult to master therefore you will waste a lot of time until you find the appropriate configuration for your style of play. Another detail that upset me was that the actor who voices Chopin does not want to or emphasize some important situations, it seems that he only began to read the script when he was constipated and they left him that way. The game has a multiplayer mode that is pretty dead, it took me like 3 months to find someone willing to play it with me. Leaving aside the problems it may have, it is worth it especially if you buy it when it has a discount because it is almost free, it is a game that will make you get out of the routine since it is quite challenging at the highest levels, and It is very comforting when you manage to overcome a rival after several unsuccessful attempts, in fact you get to feel like a true pianist.

This genre badly needs more titles such as this as Anyland is in a way a simplified Game engine such as Unreal or Unity in game form, so again with more updates, bug fixes, and a much needed desktop/controller mode for quick building on a laptop on the go, this will be one of my favorite games of all time.

"XCOM 2 es el mejor juego de estrategia por lejos! TIENEN QUE COMPRARLO Y VIVIR LA EXPERIENCIA DE SALVAR A LA TIERRA. Todo en XCOM funciona bien, desde su historia, su contenido, jugabilidad, sonidos, gráficos, es perfecto para sentir una tensión inigualable por otro juego. La premisa es que perdimos la guerra contra la invasión alienígena (XCOM: Enemy Unknown) y capturaron al comandante (Nosotros) para realizar simulaciones de operaciones tácticas con el fin de destrozar a la resistencia. Ahora debemos liberarlo para que vuelva a las fuerzas del programa XCOM y ser el último bastión contra las fuerzas extraterrestres establecidas en un nuevo régimen dictatorial, donde la libertad y derechos humanos son conceptos inexistente. Tenemos variadas ayudas a nuestra disposición para cumplir el objetivo, los operadores de XCOM, soldados altamente entrenados que van ganando experiencia y formando lazos con sus compañeros para mejoras de habilidades, especialización de estos en roles como armas pesadas, comando, francotirador, médico, sin mencionar las increíbles unidades que se van descubriendo a medida que avanza el juego (No voy a spoilear!). Todo esto te hace sentir un cariño especial por las personas que se embarcan en una misión peligrosa, y para mí, siempre que los veo yendo en el Skyranger a un lugar conflictivo, donde cada movimiento puede causar la muerte permanente de un personaje, me da angustia y las ganas de no querer fallar absolutamente nada para no perderlos en acción. Toda la información previa a las misiones y al estado del mundo en sí, lo hacemos desde el AVENGER, una nave alienígena interceptada por la resistencia para mimetizar sus operaciones y ser casi invisibles al ojo de ADVENT. La base se puede ampliar para crear más instalaciones para mejorar el arsenal de armas, reclutar infantería, fabricar robots, mercado ♥♥♥♥♥, contacto con otros miembros de la resistencia y encontrar puntos importantes con el análisis de sectores mundiales. Ninguna partida será igual a la anterior o a la que tuvo tu amigo, a veces las misiones se repiten en ambiente pero los movimientos de los enemigos son totalmente al azar, y te pondrán a prueba sin piedad en el campo de batalla. La base también te informa de tus estadísticas mensuales con respecto a tu rendimiento, el juego va en un calendario mensual y todo segundo es importante en la creación de artefactos para tu beneficio, pero también puede ser la muerte si no se considera el avance del Proyecto AVATAR, que busca destruir a la humanidad creando a otro comandante para los enemigos con la información capturada de nosotros. Si este llega al máximo, se pierde el juego en su totalidad, por lo mismo se recompensa al jugador mensualmente desde los altos mandos del programa XCOM con dinero, recursos y profesionales como ingenieros o trabajadores para la base con el fin de mejorar los esfuerzos para liberar al planeta y a la humanidad. Diferentes eventos requerirán decisiones difíciles y lugares a los que concurrir, queda en ti decidir si será mejor salvar rehenes o recuperar artefactos para mejoría armamentística, no olvides que todo repercute en la historia, puede ser tu fin en un instante.  La música del juego es hermosa, te da la experiencia de guerra y tensión en un conflicto donde la humanidad está al borde del colapso, las armas suenan bien, explosiones, en este apartado no tiene nada que envidiar a su predecesor. Gráficamente corre bien, no perfecto, no se ve muy optimizado y cuesta tener 60 fps pegados en mi Notebook HP OMEN 15 con procesador i7-7700hq, 16 de RAM 2400Mhz, Nvidia Geforce GTX 1060 6GB Max-Q Design y HDD 1 TB, pero no necesito alto rendimiento para un juego de estrategia como en los shooters,  pero aún así hay que tener un buen PC para darle una pasada con calidad, ya que las texturas, los efectos ambientales, el post procesamiento, y otras cositas más, creanme que son un deleite a la vista. Lamentablemente hay un PERO. El juego posee DLCs, algunos no cambian la experiencia en nada más que skins y más armas o alguna otra cosa innecesaria para la experiencia del juego base, pero War Of The Chosen le da un nuevo nivel a XCOM 2, transformándolo en un juego totalmente nuevo que sin duda alguna tienen que comprar. Armas, facciones, enemigos extremadamente difíciles y un nuevo ángulo de la historia antes inexplorado son algunas de las cosas que añade esta expansión. Si pensaban que el juego sin estas expansiones era complejo, esperen a peliar contra algún Elegido, ahí si que la misión se va a la mierda XD Recomiendo totalmente XCOM 2 para cualquier persona, incluso para los que no les gustan los juegos de estrategia, es una experiencia que no se les va a olvidar. Todo funciona perfecto en el juego para darte entretención, y en ningún momento se siente injusto (en realidad a veces sí con las probabilidades de matar a un enemigo, donde quieres romper el computador cuando con un 99% el soldado falla el tiro jajajaj). TIENEN QUE COMPRARLO! 10/10 Y CON EL DLC War Of The Chosen 1000000000000/10",True,False

"I had only played O2Jam when I was in the first place as a rhythm game, but anyway, I had a very interesting memory at the time of O2Jam, so I bought it. The first thing I felt during the game was that the song was so good. There are even a lot of songs with Korean lyrics, and the quality of the songs is considerable! Well, like all these games, it takes a long time to become a deceased person, and even if you hit the perfect, it is quite difficult to become the top deceased person among the deceased characters, depending on whether you hit the perfect with MAX 100% or just hit the perfect. So, if you just love the song and enjoy the rhythm game, you can play it without much stress. To briefly write down what I felt while playing: 1. It was a simple score judgment, but it aroused a desire to challenge and became a fun factor rather than a stress factor. 2. Variety of song types and considerable quality I want to unlock all songs by leveling up quickly rather than improving my skills. The genre is also very diverse. 3. A keyboard that supports simultaneous input I feel that the essential keyboard should have good performance. It is difficult to properly enjoy this game with a bad keyboard that cannot input one or two when multiple simultaneous inputs. 4. Has collection elements. It looks like a variety, but I don't know how much because the play time is small. 5. Unique AIR mode This was really novel. I feel like enjoying a rhythm game with gamers all over the world. I can't see the output chat, but... 6. Various keys, various levels of difficulty Supports 4 to 8 keys, and supports various elements that can increase the level of difficulty (note transparency, etc.). All for the deceased. 7.

"Left 4 Dead 2 is a nice production where you can have a pleasant time especially with friends. Valve has once again demonstrated its quality, especially the graphics are still not bad on the eye, but soft and pleasant. Even when you have finished all the maps of the game, you can access the map series from the steam workshop and some of them may even be better than stock maps. At the beginning of the review, I mentioned that you can have a good time with friends. However, if you are the only person, it is not possible to get the same taste no matter how different you play with different people or how much you play on your own. It has been so many years since its debut, but it hasn't lost anything, on the contrary, it won thanks to the steam workshop. I do not know if there are people who do not play, but I think that players who do not play should definitely have this experience with their friends. ",True,False
"Introduction: Deadpool is the only comic book character who broke through the fourth wall. For those who do not know, I will explain that the fourth wall is the line between the reader and the characters of the comics, between the viewer and the characters of the film ... Deadpool realizes that he is in the comic book and often communicates with his fans and suffers from a BUG of personality. There are voices in his head that also understand that they are in a comic book or game. Another feature of Deadpool is that he completely overthrows the dogma of superheroes and kills the villains, which is characteristic of anti-heroes, which actually is Deadpool.  Gameplay: What does the gameplay touch? - It's not necessary to describe the gameplay in a special way: we are playing for Deadpool - this immediately implies that complete insanity awaits us (in a good sense, it's clear). Although officially the game received a genre of action, in some places it seemed to me that this is a real slasher. Deadpool takes opponents out just packs, killing one after the other and stuffing just huge combos. In the arsenal, he has for this case a whole bunch of weapons: from a pistol and uzi to his traditional katan. As the game progresses, we will be able to pump out its entire arsenal and discover new weapons for it. You can pump the weapon at the expense of coins, which in their style repeat the mask of Deadpool.  A spoon of tar: What kind of game can do without cons? In my opinion, they are not. You can always find fault with a few trifles. Deadpool also has them, but they are not significant and do not cancel the fact that the game is cool. I personally did not like the sharp disruptions of complexity. At first, we were given light-hearted rivals who seemingly can not kill the immortal Deadpool, but sometimes they get it. And with the final of the game, the developers have clearly over-ridden, which was noted, probably, by almost all surveyors. Personally, I spent a lot of time on the finals, but he practically did not change my idea of ​​the game.  As for the optimization here in general, all in two words: ""everything is gorgeous!""  In the end, I can only once again praise the developers of High Moon Studios and condemn the publishers who pinched the money to make the game even better. Probably he did not make big bets on the game, but it clearly turned out. I can say that this is a purely average game that does not have time to get bored and does not seem short. In it everything is done exactly medium, but the efforts of the creators clearly go far beyond this mark. ",True,False

"To be honest, I expected less than I received in the end. Sam's story is, in its own way, a very atmospheric DLC, which tells us about the further fate of one of the Aurora crew members, namely American Sam, whose main goal is to get home to America by all means. Compared to the previous expansion, Sam's story lasts significantly longer, and the player is presented with a much less linear plot, and even small side quests are encountered. From the gameplay chips, motor boats appeared, the control of which I really liked very much, all the same, 4A Games can use realistic technology. I also really liked the location of the add-on, the half-flooded Vladivostok has its own atmosphere, which differs from the original game. But again, unlike the ""Two Colonels"" in this expansion, I liked the gameplay more than the plot. This is of course subjective, but the plot is a solid cliche, here you have a hopeless deal, and two warring characters who hate each other, and a sudden enemy who rallies the once warring parties. The plot twists cannot be called unexpected, everything is too natural and expected. But this is no less interesting, and I cannot say that my passage of this supplement was boring, by no means, it left only positive emotions. But to be honest, it seems to me that the price is too high, for the same money you can buy Redux versions of Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light, yes, this add-on costs money, but obviously not 899 rubles. But since I bought it in the ""Gold Edition"" kit and at a discount, it didn't really affect me. Otherwise, everything is fine. Recommend. ",True,False

"Launching the game ... The splash screen is already impressive. But in the game itself, unrestrained fun awaits us in terms of the extermination of incomprehensible people and cops who are trying to protect them. For law and order! But not next to the main character, who is clearly hit on the head, and maybe on something else: D Let's go ... On the first mission, I managed to have fun in scenario mode and understand what was going on here, banging people, performing side quests, beats off a cloud of police detachments, we shoot back with a rifle, a pistol, and throw grenades into crowds of people ... and then an unexpected thing appears. At the end of the mission, when there is only one person left to kill, whom I specially run past, I decide to run around the map to explore the territory, and I stumble upon ... an exploding balloon. Of course, the hands could not resist and it is imperative to shoot at him and see what will happen, he did not make him wait long, the bombing was great, the hero flew off onto the road, and from above (so that it did not seem a little) a police car was driving along the hero. Class, it chuckled: D The scenario mode seemed easy (we need more cool exploding balloons), turn on the crazy difficulty mode. Let's go further. Somehow cops drive up to me, but they were not taught the culture, the doors of the car do not know how to close, the currency of cops, I sit in the driver's seat, and the hero has short hands to close the passenger door, go out, sit on the passenger side, close the door, crawl to the place of the carrier, I go out, sit down in the place of the carrier, the op and the doors are closed: D Otherwise, it’s not a thrill to drive with the doors open, it will blow some more, and the hero is clearly not healthy xD The car control is strange, so the driving lessons were postponed for later. In general, the impressions went in the very first minutes and on the very first mission :) What will happen next we will run and study, I do not think that the game will make you bored :) I advise the game! P.S. But the management will have to get used to. Although this is not the first game I meet, I play and go through with a second-person view, the controls seemed a little strange and inconvenient to me, but I think it will get used to it.

"Different from the urgent feeling of violence after a complete and in-depth experience of the gameplay, my first impression of this game is very plain. The movement direction of the characters in the main interface is inconsistent with the background scroll direction. It is a sense of violation and the simple opening animation of the stream of consciousness makes me Even laughed out loud. After entering the game, the novice guidance and operation teaching were arranged before the start of the first battle. When entering the map interface for the first time, I didn't know how to play and I was a little at a loss for the complicated UI. After successfully starting the battle with experience and exploration, and gradually understanding the system design in several fiascos, I was fascinated by the complexity and diversity of the core mechanism but it was easy to understand, and I had a happy experience in the ""one more round"". . Why should the deficiencies appear in the evaluation first? Because the shortcomings of this game are almost covered in the above paragraph, everything else (from numerical value to system to style) is very delicate and delicate. These intuitive shortcomings are concentrated in the understanding stage of the early game experience. Once you can overcome these small frustrations and doubts and calm down to experience the gameplay and mechanism, the exquisiteness of this game can be truly touched. Before introducing the mechanism, let’s talk about the screens that are easiest to persuade. In order to save manpower and material resources, independent games often choose to present them in 2D pixel style, which is easy to be full of cheapness. The art of Fantasy Dongzheng has its advantages in character recognition and scene harmony. After the increase in the number of characters on the same screen in the later period, the superposition of various skill animations is not chaotic, and even a trace of epic is superimposed, which is worthy of the name of ""Eastern March"". The design of the Boss image is the most surprising, which will be mentioned in the following paragraphs. As an independent game, this game is breathtakingly high in terms of gameplay completion. At the core of the gameplay, the fantasy east march is actually the development and combination of auto chess pieces + tower climbing reward mechanism + Rogue-like random background and a large number of subsystems. At first it sounds like an LD41 ""combination incompatible type"" entry, but after it was really mixed-although it is hard to say which ingredients are due to it-an incredible chemical reaction did occur. In the combat system, chess pieces are distinguished by basic attributes such as life attack and defensive crit, a common skill and a special skill; they can be divided into three camps, each with its own strengths, and the number of the same camps in the team reaches the standard with attribute bonuses. ; According to the different positioning of the chess pieces, they can be divided into fronts, each performing their duties, such as charging, covering, magic, etc., and the formation of fronts also has a bonus; the team can accommodate 4×3=12 people, divided into front and back armies, enjoy Different bonuses; collect three identical chess pieces to get a massive upgrade. Only at the above-mentioned basic level, the choice of chess pieces, upgrade routes, and formation of troops have created depth. The design of the hero system is also not redundant. The player is not like pure auto chess and can only watch by the side. Instead, it can be used as a pawn and participate in the changes of the battlefield with unique attack methods and skills, which improves the interaction and immersion. sense. The attributes, skills, and equipment of the hero itself can bring a series of dimensions and related systems to deepen. As a Rogue-like, the completion of the subsystem is also quite good. The first is a battle reward in the form of one of three choices, allowing players to choose between chess pieces and props. This choice will be affected by the attributes of the chess pieces and the strength of the props and the team fit. In addition to encountering monsters in the map, there are also neutral nodes such as shops, temples, unknown events, and hero upgrades. The shop is a place where you can trade chess pieces and purchase additional items, so as to increase the statistical probability of three consecutive games. Temple and Blessing is one of the most outstanding designs in the game. It is equivalent to attaching a permanent talent to a piece. The large-scale talent pool and the ability of countless pieces form a combination, and there will be countless effects worth trying. The design of BOSS is really pleasantly surprised. The high specificity of attack method, stage and image has reached the level of BOSS in RPG. The reason for spoiler is not repeated. In short, when the player encounters the wasteland for the first time, he is surprised and can think about different strategies. Even if the system is huge, after a long time of communication and polishing with the players, the fantasy east march has been quite in place in the details, and the season has smoothed out the conflicts that multiple systems may bring, such as basic numerical design and balance, the maximum number of talents, and the triple connection Time talent processing, the number of chess pieces in the camp considering the probability of three consecutive times, the battle of hero chess pieces, etc. As a multi-system Rogue-like known for its randomness, can you match your own genre in any system to strengthen your hero status? Prefer a certain front? A certain camp? Anything is possible. You can eat fresh all over the world with one trick, or you can try different combinations. As for expansibility, it is very easy to imagine that it is not difficult to launch new chess piece-shaped camp-shaped props or even new scenes and new bosses, laying a convenient cornerstone for the later development of the game. This is a domestic independent game with extremely rich gameplay and a fusion of multiple core gameplay. Considering that there is such a high degree of completion only in the early experience, players who are interested in the combination of Rogue-like and auto chess will definitely not lose the experience.

"I have been playing CS:GO for a fairly long time and looking back on it I have a lot of memories both good and bad thanks to CS:GO, all those nights I stayed up solo queing or playing with friends, all the days I spent playing instead of revising for exams (RIP) and CS:GO allowed me to meet lots of people and become involved in things I never thought I would. The thing I still love to this day is that this game can be fun even if none of your friends have it or you have no friends. Solo queing can be risky as you can meet strange foreigners or just get bad team mates all round, ut thats part of the fun. I would also reccomend not buying this game if you have exams coming up. I had met some great people and obviously once in a while you encounter the odd d1ckh34d, but the addiction of playing made me join teams and even start my own team with friends and eventually became a competitive team while being sponsored. This was something I never thought would have ever happened to me and its a memory that will stay with me forever. Happiness is when you play CS so well, that people call you a hacker. Although CS:GO has lots of great aspects and the community has some great people...This game has become such a meme I can't even bring myself to play it anymore. The amount of Russians swearing down the mic, which by the way is potato quality and all the swedish 13yr olds thinking they will be a Fnatic or NiP player is unreal. The community has become so toxic and just unbareable that its essentially ruined the game for me. Feel free to disagree if you love the community but thats just me.   Basically... Buy the game if you want an addictive tactical FPS game but bewarned the game is such a meme and the community is so cancerous that you may hate the game fairly quickly.

The path we face is very diverse - each location has its own subtleties, its own atmosphere (some locations are quite beautiful, and some are creepy - a good horror would come out of the metro tunnels, for example) and their own tasks for solving, both simple and not so ... Locations in which the necessary items are, and all kinds of passwords for safes and doors, change radically based on 3-4 options. On the way to the final goal, we will come across notes, easter eggs and secrets, the number of which will directly affect the ending (one of three). here it is quite simple: - we explore the area in search of provisions and useful items. The character constantly needs food to maintain the level of health (in the case of difficulties in finding food, you can use the first aid kit). An indicator of health (hunger) is the cleanliness of the inventory (notebook). If the sheets of paper are white, healthy. There are blood spots or smudges - it's time to restore health. When everything floats and darkens before your eyes - it's really bad. Also, along the way, we will need batteries for a flashlight, weapons and side (quest) things. - we shoot extremely rarely and this is a plus, since the physics of shooting is not entirely successful, and the enemies do not really want to die. In other words, we rarely shoot, but accurately - there is no other way. - we solve small riddles, mainly for attentiveness. To see in the right place the right number to install a certain part, notice the weakness of the structure in order to break it and get what we are looking for, find the right thing on the shelf with junk, etc. For the whole game, one bug got out - the main character resolutely refused to take out any weapon or at least a camera (there was no reaction to the keys 1,2,3,4). I got to autosave, restarted the game - everything passed. As a result, we have a sad and interesting story in the atmospheric world, which ""sinks"" into the soul. After the end credits, I stared at the black screen for a long time, hoping that this was not the end. The game and the emotions experienced are definitely worth the money spent.

"Must've been around 10 years since I've played and finished the original Mafia II. I did really enjoy the game back then so when this remastered version came out I thought it would be a good time to endulge myself into the Mafia again.  I did not play the original Mafia II first to see if this remastered version is a big improvement or not but from what I've seen the game holds up very nice even after 10 years. Empire Bay (a mix of Chicago, New York and San Francisco) still has an amazing atmosphere of that era and great to drive around in.  That said, this is not a GTA clone. Yes, Mafia II is an open world game but there is not that much filler content like in GTA. Mafia II pretty much focuses on the main story line. There are no sidequests except maybe some ways to make money like bringing cars to the scrap heap and robbing shops/gasstations.  The variations of cars is quite limited, as would be realistic around 1950. You can buy a few new clothes and guns but there was not one moment in the game where I actually needed to buy guns. The clothes come in handy whenever you are wanted with the police and have to change clothes.  You can also bring a car to the garage to repaint it and change the license plate so the car is not wanted anymore. Customisation of cars is also quite limited and unnecessary.  The story however is quite good. The game really feels like a Mafia movie, albeit with a lot of scenes directly stolen from the movies but that's fine by me.  Currently I did not finish the remastered version of the game yet because of a game breaking bug at the end of chapter 14 where Joe as to go see a doctor. Somehow the game thought Vito was in the car , which he was not....  I could not kill myself so the only thing I could do is try to restart the game. This did not work because my savegame is broken which forces me to restart Chapter 14. This would be okay with me under normal circumstances but Chapter 14 is quite a long chapter with some annoying filler content. Also, I probably will not get the achievement for finishing Mafia II on hard mode. I will update this once I completely finished Mafia II and played some of the DLC. ",True,False

"Gameplay review: Overall, it wasn't bad Open world, but it was regrettable that the content was lacking, and the game started to become easier all of a sudden from the middle of the game because of brainwashing the Uruk captains. Among the quests, there are ques that help strengthen the uruk captains brainwashed, and if you use them really well, the part that makes the game balance revamped. It is said that a sequel will be released, so I am curious about how the regrets in this work will be improved and updated. There are more things I want to write, but I will stop because of the annoyance.. Rating: 8.5 out of 10 The reason is a little insufficient content, deceptive quests that make the game too easy.. In this respect, I tried to give my rating 6.5 points. My favorite movie, the Lord of the Rings' worldview as a motif, added bonus points in terms of killing enemies in a variety of ways like Assassin's Creed. ",True,False

"an overview of Assassin's Creed Liberation HD would be incomplete without mentioning an important innovation coming to this game. It's about costumes, which the developers proudly call masks. Avelina can act as a slave, assassin or lady, changing clothes and appearance. The most interesting face is the latter, since the feminine heroine in this image does not carry many weapons with her, does not jump on roofs and trees, but slays enemies with her charm. Having flirted with a guard, he can be taken to a secluded place, and there mercilessly and quietly killed. Interestingly, you can change your identity at any time, that is, it seems that you can play the same episode of the game in different ways, and this is good news. Another important thing that has changed in the game is the graphics. The developers added the ""HD"" prefix to the name of the project, and also tried to improve the animation and appearance of the characters. Avelina really became prettier, but the animation leaves much to be desired. Moreover, Assassin's Creed Liberation HD has a serious problem with the details of the game world. If in the pocket version of the project it was not too noticeable, then on the big screen the poverty of the locations instantly catches your eye. Assassin's Creed Liberation HD is a slightly modified version of an interesting game for a portable console. It is far from the standards of other ambitious projects in this series, but it still has some pleasant advantages, including: an interesting protagonist, new locations, disguises and updated graphics. However, the plot of the game is poor, the world is not at all detailed, and the missions leave much to be desired. But still, we are confident that Assassin's Creed Liberation HD is worth the money.

"Hey hey ~ Je vous retrouve ici pour vous donner une évaluation objective sur les points les plus importants de ce jeu, pouvant justifier pour vous son achat, ou pas. Alors l'histoire.. Quelque chose qui me semble important dans un jeu de ce type. Je vais être direct, c'est mitigé. On à une trame assez classique : grand vilain sur dernière mission, et avant lui on va rendre visite à tout ses lieutenants et hommes de main les uns après les autres. Rien de bien original, mais efficace normalement.  Alors quoi? Pourquoi c'est mitigé? ... C'est plat. Vraiment plat. On incarne pas Emily ou Corvo, mais Superman. On va aller descendre les lieutenants les uns après les autres sans difficultés, sans péripéties entre, sans rebondissements, sans une écorchure ( parce que j'ai vérifié, j'ai porté le même costume du début à la fin de l'histoire, il est pas déchiré, ni sale, et pourtant une des missions se passe à Poussièreville ). C'est assez exaspérant de voir que l'Impératrice perd son trône et le regagne en 9 jours avec un ratio d'un jour = 1 méchant et ses 65 gardes.  Pas une seule fois on se fait chopper, enfermer, capturer ou perdre un doigt. Pas une seule fois un de ces lieutenants se met en état d'alerte suite aux événements des missions précédentes pour nous proposer autre chose qu'une ligne droite. 9 missions, 9 lieutenants qui jouent avec le canard en plastique dans le bain sans nous voir sur la poutre du plafond. Pour résumer, la trame principale est un sprint, et ce n'est pas un 100m haies. C'est bien plat. PLAT. _________________________________________________________________________ Néanmoins, un point important que je tiens à souligner et qui fait du bien au lore, c'est les documents et infos. Partout dans toutes les missions : livres, lettres, cartes, audios et autres sauront sustenter les plus curieux, vont nous faire apprendre beaucoup de choses au niveau de la situation, des personnages, du passé, et aussi nous donner de nombreux indices de missions donnant lieu à des possibilités alternatives. Le tout dans un bon gros porte-documents que l'on à toujours sur soi, des archives probablement conservées dans le vide vu leur taille, accessibles à n'importe quel moment. C'est un vrai plaisir de fouiner dans la vie des gens et de se dire que cette lettre trouvée sur ce bureau nous à fait comprendre comment cette personne en est arrivée là. Je mentionnais çi-dessus l'alternativité. Je pense que c'est la clé de voûte de ce jeu. Énormément de choix à faire, de manières de procéder, de chemins à trouver sur les maps.. Tout est une harmonieuse tapisserie qui se tisse entre le niveau de chaos que l'on génère, nos choix sur les objectifs de missions, notre façon de réagir aux situations, le choix des pouvoirs ( ils nous orientent réellement sur un gameplay ). C'est une satisfaction également de voir à la mission suivante ce que nos choix ont engendrés comme changements. Même les conversations des civils entre eux ( si il en reste ) dépendront de vos actions. Côté gameplay, recette propre à Dishonored : pouvoirs, charmes d'os modifiants des particularités, le mode de combat n'a pas changé, la furtivité non plus. Le nouveau sera seulement la possibilité de craft ses propres charmes d'os, nous poussant encore plus intensément dans notre choix de Gameplay et pouvant à la longue faire de nous un personnage sous GodMod. Les graphismes, autre point noir au tableau, à côté de la trame principale aussi plate que la ville de Grenoble. Ils sont bien évidemment agréables et assez poussés, surtout au niveau des ombres et éclairages qui donnent le ton et font partie intégrante de l'ambiance de ce jeu. Malheureusement c'est très ( trop ) gourmand, et mal optimisé. Les plus grosses configs peinent à atteindre leurs 60 FPS en Élevé. Autant dire que pour les moyennes ou basses configs, vous cracherez sur les graphismes du jeu et vous contenterez du gameplay, faute de quoi l'explosion d'une mine pourra engendrer un crash pour vous ! Malgrès l'histoire linéaire en 9 missions, le jeu sera étonnement long si vous vous y intéressez : - Fins et objectifs alternatifs à foison - Nombre de secrets, pouvoirs, documents complétant le lore disséminés sur la map, faisant passer le temps de mission de 30min à 1-2h - Nombreuses façons de faire et procéder - Possible de jouer en refusant les pouvoirs ( très intéressant comme expérience ) - Plusieurs niveaux de difficulté - Possibilité de NewGame +, ce qui est intéressant pour monter en difficulté Alors en résumé, on à une histoire sympa mais qui se passe malheureusement trop bien, rehaussé par un lore foisonnant et beaucoup de révélations. Le gameplay ne change pas, il est resté ce pourquoi on aime Dishonored. La multitude de façon de procéder ainsi que les choix et l'alternativité est passionnant et très accrocheur. Cela jouera évidemment dans une longévité, qui ne se mesure pas aux nombre de missions composant le jeu, mais à tout ce qu'il y'a à découvrir et essayer. Pour les graphismes, c'est dommage pour 80% des gens qui achèteront ce jeu, ils n'en profiteront pas pleinement et c'est regrettable car c'était une bonne plus-value. Ce jeu offre de bons moments, est accrocheur mais l'histoire trop plate et l'optimisation l’entache. Je le recommande car il fera partie de la culture vidéo-ludique, mais le prix de 19$ pendant les Summer Sales était plus justifié.",True,False

"I've never experienced something like this game's story mode. You won't find the same Cliché that the other games offer these days in their story mode. There are not any good neither bad endings , just different interpretations. I actually was pretty disappointed of my chosen ending until I finally understood its true meaning. The fact that I find the most interesting about the story is that the antithesis is more complicated than just ""the bad guys"" and ""the good guys"". You'll find out by playing it. The gameplay is great , but nothing really special compared to the older Far Cry games. Same thing with the graphics: not a big upgrade, just some small improvements ( in my opinion) but I guess it's fine since the older games were perfect the way they were, RIGHT? (*still my opinion*) Overall, I feel this might been the best Far Cry ever created. (again: it's my opinion) Objectively, this game is 100% worth the money. Hope I helped :3 ",True,False

"There is a Belarusian language! It's amazing ... it's amazing to catch yourself thinking that the game is relaxing on streams. You watch work activities from a sphere that is not very familiar for our region, and even railway stations ... but trains ... all this big technology is fascinating. It plays just as well. There is a list of certain things to do and the full will of arranging comfort in small stations. The locations are quite varied and the complexity of the actions is constantly growing so as not to become a silly routine. A room with a train has also been created for entertainment. Waiting for us at the firm and we lengthen our staff, depending on the meticulousness of the passage. Let's run on rails - just nice modeling aesthetics. In addition, there is a lot of text about the first trains, the features of the railway and tells about the latest successes of train construction. Something you know, but somewhere the brain will grow up along with the new information. Everything would be fine, but ... you can clear the entire station, furnish it like a millionaire's house, but ... in the center there will be a bottle that is highlighted .. is garbage ... but does not rise ... in any way ... perfectionists turn gray at this point. In special zones there is a task for required elements. Here is the toilet. And there were elements in it that just needed to be replaced ... but they are not put. Dryers, dispensers, urinals are not put in the toilet ... but on the street they are ... Arghgh .. If you want the voice of Mr. Miyagi to sound in your head with the phrase ""We wipe it off"" - play.

"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 8/10 (Nostalgic, Immersive, Fun) About 30 years ago, when Dungeon Master first came out on the Apple II, I remembered spending many sleepless nights exploring the dungeons. There was just so much to do, and I would keep exploring the same dungeons with a different party of 4 heroes. The legend of Grimrock brings back that wonderful feeling of nostalgia for me, except the graphics and sound effects are so much better than that of yesteryear. It brings back that heart pounding feeling as I assemble my team of Ratlings, Minotaurs, Lizardmen, Insectoids and Humans and go deep down into the dungeons. In my old age, I am still spending that many sleepless nights adventuring. So, if you are a senior like me who longs for that exciting fun filled dungeon, I would recommend Grimrock 1 & 2 to you.

"The continuation of the Metro 2033 game about ""Dom-2"" in the tunnels aims to give the player all the same pleasure, but more, better, and on board Regina. This is a classic staged shooter with good shootouts, stealth and scenes, each of which deserves the player's closest attention, but not because it is obligatory, but simply interesting. Developers from 4A Games correctly appreciated the positive aspects of their previous game and developed successful ideas. The story begins almost immediately after the events of the original (although there are two endings, and I am outraged that I am credited with those actions that I did not do and did not want) and a little loosely follows the original book. The protagonist Artyom, as a result of a successful explosion operation in the opinion of the metro-residents, is included in the ranks of the ""Spartans"" - the elite of the new world, the knights of the underground. The local esoteric Khan sees the whole situation with blacks from the opposite, not very good side, and tries to convey his point of view to Artyom, who is tasked with destroying the last remains of black mutants. The plot is again built in the manner of a road trip. We, with weapons in hand, will now and then get stuck in situations that, according to the plan, of course, should not have been. ",True,False
"Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a one-of-a-kind horror experience. It isn't like other games that constantly jumpscare you and don't actually have any real horror to them, in fact, if I remember correctly, this game has almost no jumpscares what-so-ever. (No, I'm not gonna say where they are, that'd be spoiling!) This game immerses you in it's story, and it's truly terrifying atmosphere, and locations. The story is great, and it absolutely 100% makes cohesive, understandable sense unlike some other horror games I've played. I did grab all the notes in the game though, so the entire story was laid out to me. If you're having trouble finding them all, you have to explore and open LITERALLY everything, which - I think - is a good thing, it encourages exploration.  The graphics - at least, I believe - still hold up today, and the game still looks great. The puzzles are challenging, but not too challenging. I'm a little stupid so I had to google some of them, but after seeing what the solutions were, I immediately hated myself, because I realised that they were well within my capability, I just wasn't exploring every option, or thinking hard enough. The enemies - while don't look that scary, if you manage to sneak a look at them - are terrifying. If I'm honest, almost all of that is due to the music and sound design, because, as I said, they don't look that scary. They actually take patience and care to avoid. Yes, AVOID. You can't fight back, and I think, in my humble opinion, that's the way this game should be. No fighting back, just run and hide. The sound design is absolutely more than spot-on, honestly, sound design NEEDS to be spot-on in a horror game, otherwise it will miss the mark.  However, this game isn't amazing for achievement hunters, I have most of them, but there is one trophy I absolutely will refuse to go back and try to get, and that's the achievement you get if you collect literally EVERY TINDERBOX IN THE GAME. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Horror games are really only good to play through once, unless it's randomised, and this game is not. I find I'd get quite bored trying to play through the game again, finding every tinderbox, knowing where all the scares are and everything, but then again, I'm not really the ""achievement-hunter"" type, I don't like playing through many games over again. *looks at time played in Skyrim* Um... yeah... *cough* just ignore that... (Do not read this if you want to discover secrets for yourself)  And if you've finished the story of Amnesia: The Dark Descent (don't read this spoiler if you didn't read the first one)   then you can still play more of this game! Because this game has an awesome feature. It supports custom stories. So, if you want, you can go to websites, download custom stories, and play stories that the community has made, and continue on with your Amnesia experience, or, make your own. I assume there are tools to make custom stories somewhere, and official websites to download custom stories from, I haven't looked into it yet. However, unlike the official game, quality varies. There's no quality control on custom stories, so, be warned.  There, now that that spoiler is done, back to the main part of the review. Amnesia: The Dark Descent, (don't click this spoiler if you didn't read the other two)   is an amazing horror experience, and is a really good indicator of how effective horror games can really be. Absolutely 100% buy this game, even at full price, you will not regret it. Well... unless you don't like horror games, in which case, why are you even on this store page? ",True,False

"I didn't play this game so much, but i know there are many micspammers and bullyers and cheaters aka scripters but it doesnt matter if they are, you can just play without listening to him or if your team sees a cheater just votekick him because Valve cares about TF2,HL2, CS:GO and many other games so they make updates and why whould someone cheat to get more access to things or to be better, better just practice with bots and don't install cheats because they don't make you better, they make you dumber. Many people install cheats from   and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.net, they think they are smart, but actually they arrent because Valve is smart and has an automatic ban system to automaticly ban players when they leave the game with cheats on, Most scripters use: Walls,Aimbots,Spinbot(recomended for you cheaters :) ) and the triggerbots and with mod menu's. My real life friend experimented how it is to cheat with cheats but he doesnt like it because it isnt fair. The guy's that cheat(not hacking) arent really players. they don't have respect for the other players. why whould Valve not sue them? with cheats Valve loses much money. and Valve wants the games to be LEGIT.

"Overall a nice idea. You get many options to create your own little landscape; Animals, Flowers, Trees, Houses, Castles, Bridges, Decoration, Water and Weather effect, and much more.

The loud music and weird ""controller-like"" smoothed out mouse controlls (and also the keyboard controlls) threw me off a bit. A option to toggle or change some presettings would be nice (or maybe there are, and if.. making them a bit more ""aggressive"" so you dont have to play hide and seak with those things) Overall Its a fun thing to play around with and if you dont mind the controlls.. go for it But if youd like something more user-friendly for a (semi.-)prof. use, there are many other options like this out there (but they mostly cost more) ",True,False
"A few things I want to make clear first. First, this isn't a MMO. According to their own player count ingame, there has been a max of 15 unique players online today, of which the highest concurrent number I've seen in the 3 hours I've been playing is 3 with me included. Infact, in the top 50 players list, only 20 of them are above level 1. That's saying something when it took 3 hours for me to get to level 7 while idling at least 1 hour away. It's not a Massive Multiplayer Online game, but just a regular Multiplayer Online game. Second thing I want to say is that this is very similar to mobile games like Clash of Clans. If you've enjoyed that, you'll more than likely enjoy this game.  Now, onto my review. This is a full-on browser game. When you install the game on Steam and launch it, a launcher comes up with options to run their chess game, or Fasaria World Online. Clicking on FWO launches Internet Explorer and the website itself.  I have a quick list of grievances with this game that I first want to air out. When you first play the game, you start off with 10K money, food, and iron. These are the resources in this game that you must acquire. The only problem with this system is that gathering resources is way too simple. In the three hours I've been playing, I've probably gained over 15M of each resource and used/sold most of them. First off, you can hire workers to generate a steady source of income every tick/month/15 minutes but that isn't needed because you make a lot more money by grinding on mobs. Like a million in less than a minute.  Second, the engineering lab. If you're trying to understand why a health pack requires compressors, generators, and micro parts, well you're not alone there. Everything in the engineering lab requires those three sub resources for some strange reason. Be it the health pack, energy pack, strength upgrade, defense upgrade, health upgrade, or even energy upgrade, all of them require differing amounts of generators, compressors, and micro parts to my utter bewilderment. The third grievance of mine is with the Assembly Factory. In the AF, you create factories to produce generators, micro parts, and compressors. Sound good? Well, not exactly. Even if you have two of each factories, you're only allowed to collect from one factory each tick. It's as if you paid a restaurant for three meals but they only allowed you to pick one meal every fifteen minute. Utterly frustrating and it feels as if the game is trying to hard to be a grind fest.  Now a few good things that I do like about this game. First, the combat is very simple to pick up on. In fact, this reminds me of Adventure Quest, except without all the animation. Is it the best combat out there? Of course not, but it's damn well good enough considering you can also play it on mobile browsers according to the devs.  Second, I have to say that the community(although the playerbase is quite lacking) is very nice and helpful. I'd had more than a dozen questions about this game and the veteran players patiently answered all of them.  Last, it has a very high potential to be addicting. This is one of those games where you check back every 15 minutes to upgrade your base, add more troops to your army and create new factories in the Assembly Factory while collecting all your idle resources. The fact that you can log into your steam account directly on your phone's browser also adds to the fact that you can play it anywhere and at anytime.  Ultimately, I'm giving this game a thumbs up. A lot of the problems I think this game has is more or less a balancing issue with resources. Otherwise, it's a pretty fun game though lacking in the graphics department. ",True,True
"Honestly, people giving this game negative reviews must have misread the genre, or thought it was a TDM, or something like that.  The best way to describe this game is a third-person shooter MOBA. TTK is high. That is intentional. Characters have ROLES. That is intentional. You can kill any character as any character if you play it correctly, but it is a team-based shooter and you're not meant to kill the slippery squishy assassin (Tosca) as the maniac 4x his HP melee tank (Drakarl). Play objectives, force the rat to come to you, walk to your team and gank - it's exactly the same as in League. Can an Ashe except from a Talon in League? Can Ana escape from Genji in Overwatch? Same principle. Imagine playing a game for 2 hours and thinking you can say something about balance. I'm having a great time, and so is my 4-stack. Looking forward to how Amazon improves on the game with chat and optimization and hopefully ignores all of the negativity from people complaining about server issues on launch day. ",True,False

Moderate difficulty, dead cell is a typical game that is extremely difficult to start, smooth to master, and super difficult to specialize 4. Huge game content, I have not even all the props until now. Unlock, not even play or even complete the level once. 5. The dedicated production team has continuously released updates during its early access era, and each time it is a major update, it is still the current disadvantage: 1. No Multiplayer, I feel that this kind of game multiplayer will be very cool XD 2. The production team did not contribute to the plot, so this game currently only has a very very small amount of plot to speak of. -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- 9/10 Dead cells and celeste are currently in my mind Representative of excellent 2D games ",True,True

"Would you kindly play this classic fps that changed how enjoyable stale shooters and story games had become and gave birth to some of the now most iconic characters and references in the gaming world. +Deep detailed world +Vast interesting mechanics for abilities  +Satisfying gameplay even after death +Different story based on choices +Iconic noteworthy characters +Retro futuristic aesthetic  +Some sense of horror -Gloomy to the point that it looks unappealing -Difficult to have a feel of overall objective -Closed spaces without much exploration -Repetitive enemies The city of Rapture is detailed to the point where at a glance you can feel the history, ambition, and fall of the people there everywhere you look. Though for most of the game there is a sense of feeling lost to what you are really there to do and why you are doing it, it comes together in the end for a satisfying experience oozing with creativity and innovation for game at its time. A satisfying fps gameplay with its vast array of lore abilities that has something for everyone. Though its aesthetic charm may not be appealing for everyone it has a charm none the less.

"My review on Don't Starve Together This game is analogous to Don't Starve + Reign of giants DLC, only for cooperative play. The game has a ton of positive qualities: 1) The graphics - the game's drawing is simply gorgeous, a similar style is used in horror cartoons. 2) Sounds and music - music is amazing, it can both cheer and scare. And sounds give the world life and also play a role in intimidating the player. 3) The atmosphere - it is wonderful, then you have fun with friends, then at night in a cave you tremble with fear; 3 4) Hardcore - there is some hardcore in the game, but after a couple of years of playing it fades a little. 5) The game has skins - they drop out after some time from the beginning of the game, but usually they cost 0.05 cents) 6) Thanks to the Steam workshop - you can download mods and diversify the game 7) There are steam cards and badges I recommend this game, it worth the money.

Pros: -Great modernized turn based RPG combat -Slick pixel art graphics -Good variety of abilites and character building -It's got that wonderful ""one more turn"" quality -Excellent writing and comedic sense Cons: -Profound sadness when a high level oficer dies -If there's a way to check what status affects do outside of applying them to an enemy in battle, I haven't found it -Sometimes I found myself overwhelmed with too many missions going on and colonies to defend at once Overall, the core of the game is great.

"I've played a number of Grand Strategy games and this one is by far the best one out there. As far as GS games go it's simple enough to learn, but, as all GS games are, difficult to master. However, the point that makes this game so great is that there is focus not only on external forces, but internal ones as well. You have four levels of playability, from the bottom: Count, Duke, King, Emperor. At all these levels you have vassals, and you might even be a vassal yourself. A lot of the fun is in how you manage your vassals; and better yet, how you as a vassal maneuver and plot to overthrow your liege. The story aspect of this title far exceeds any other GS game I've played, to the point that when I start a session, it's extremely difficult to stop. If you are interested at all in trying Grand Strategy, I recommend you start off with this one. And that's coming from someone who doesn't particularly care for the Age of Crusades. Also, get the DLC to make your own character and house. ",True,False

"In S.T.A.L.K.E.R .: Shadow Of Chernobyl you could already feel a different world. The perspective was, of course, first-person, and in the lower corner of the screen an Akm rifle glowed ready to fire. It is what you play when you play an FPS, although in no corner of that radiation-ravaged wasteland were there traces of the smell of butter that the explosions of any Call of Duty give off, like the corn that turns inside a microwave. Nor did they breathe the sulfur that, in their bloody frenzy, the demons from Mars leave in their wake. That terrifying and sad world born of a nuclear disaster remembered more, saving the distances of the design, Fallout.

"Short version: This game is good. Buy! Long version: One of the best if not the best combat system I have ever experience. It definitely going to take practice but you wouldn't feel like you are wasting time practicing this game, because the game does such a good job of rewarding your beautiful combo by giving you the satisfaction of hitting max-act and such.  This very deep, complex combat system is the main selling point for me, but for some it might turn them away because they are looking to have fun, not looking to mastering something, and then have fun. DMC 5 is by no mean a game that you have to master to have fun, and it is not as difficult as you might think. You can beat this game if you are not a dead weight. Story wise, it took me around 10-12 hours to complete the story. You might think that is too short for a $60 AAA title. I think so too, but at least it doesn't drag on and on with random quests or filler missions, just straight to the point. Also, replay is a must for this game, so although story is 10 hours, you not gonna be able to keep yourself from playing it all over again with new difficulty. Now this is coming from a person who don't often spend $60 for a relatively new game, especially during this time where triple A games mostly fail to deliver.

"The TL;DR is as short as the game, under 30 Minutes, the atmosphere makes you feel a bit uneasy, the puzzle solving can be difficult. No soundtrack.  - I've never called a game a walking simulator before and I'm not even quite sure this is a walking simulator as you do interact very minimally with the objects around you. your character won't tell you where to go or what to do so you will need to interact with each individual thing.  - There is exactly ONE puzzle in the late game, it will take you some time to find and if you can't find it, there's a guide with the puzzle done. There's no soundtrack to this game, but the games uneasy quietness compliments the games graphics. The graphics on this game are very minimal. Like Chillia's Arts other games they're known for their grain/VCR look but not quite as intense as puppet combos. This one especially is very dark with a lot of dark tones, like black, Grey, Brown even the grass was dark. It definitely helped set in the mood. The game resides in Japan, it actually portrays some of the locations really well. So you're walking back home, you recently moved with your mother, the voice acting is a thing in this game, you announce your presence that you're home and there's no one there.    Thank you for reading, and if your curiosity got the better of you and you read the spoiler before playing, sorry not sorry but it's the story and with a game as small as it was that covered everything.

"Great simulator. Beautiful graphics, but everything in the game is done just fine. Not an intricate plot, it seems that it is easier to take the load at point ""A"" and take it to point ""B"".

There are many different sites where these add-ons can be downloaded. There is a Multiplayer where you can play online with friends or alone. The game was released in 2012 and is still constantly supported by the developer, constantly updated and supplemented with various chips. You can write a lot about the game and say good things, but until you start playing yourself, you will not feel all the delights of this game.

"I had not played this game from 1998 until now in 2020 ... of course I knew it but it had not fallen into my hands. I have to say that I really enjoyed it. It is true that the graphics are outdated and the gameplay is a bit rough (skating) for my taste, but that does not mean to immerse you fully in the story. The game is very well designed and I can understand why it marked a before and after: an interesting and well-captured plot, interaction with non-player characters, well-made enemy design, the levels interlaced in such a way that development does not stop, it is like a movie (for the time it is very new), well-designed plans and puzzles, medium-high difficulty, very original weapons, Anyway, I highly recommend it, playing this piece of history and putting yourself in context, it helps understand what was and the news that half life brought, and helps to understand the evolution of the shooter. a marvel.

"Getting to know Sleeping Dogs was a complete surprise, a discovery, as the toy has become one of the best games in the open world for me. A colorful, fascinating and not intricate upstart, which, as it seems to me, showed what a modern GTA should be, certainly having done it, though not in all, but in many respects! The city and its atmosphere is one of the main trump cards of the ""dogs"", you need to see it, here is the effort to illuminate the culture from different sides and everything that is, everything fits here almost perfectly, at times, at first I even admired it, the work is visible with the naked eye ... The plot is, of course, banal and it is unlikely that something will be remembered here or will make you draw attention to yourself, although there are decent attempts, nevertheless everything goes through very lively and easily, a minimum of drama is a maximum of action, apparently that's why you don't have time to survive somewhere, somewhere to be horrified, and so on, and the actors, that is, say Tom Wilkinson, who voiced Pendrew (your commander, please love and favor: D) was repeatedly nominated for an Oscar and Emma Stone, though not for long, so the search and selection of actors was carried out here , apparently, sickly. Everything related to sound is beyond praise, I don't know who these people are, but thank you so much, they have great taste, they did a great job)) And how nice it is to get into the car, turn on the radio station, no matter which one and roll the checkers on the track avoiding collisions, setting records for clean driving; doing this, one of my favorite aspects of the game, as it turned out later, well, really cool, in GTA and other games I did not experience such pleasure from the process: D And nowhere will they get bored, the essence of the tasks, for example, is very diverse, starting with that you are being asked to scare away a violent drunkard from the shop, ending with an investigation of a series of kidnappings of illegal girls! There are exciting races and, of course, fierce, at times, battles! However, there is still a lot to talk about this game and its possibilities, and I sincerely wish everyone to feel its ""climate"", because soon we will have to play in the continuation of sleeping dogs, I am sure even more picturesque and colorful, no less cool and dizzying that just can not but rejoice!

"I had this game a long time ago on desura. It was a fun, gory and brainless Barbarian 2 inspired indie game. It was far from perfect but it was a good nostalgia fix I'm happy to see that the ""extended cut"" version is finally released on steam. While still far from perfect, this new version is truly improved in many ways. Better visuals (reminiscent of what we used to see on Atari and Amiga back in the days), better and tighter control scheme (the dpad is finally working... so, no more stupid deaths while falling on pikes), extended map, a trade system etc. So, should you buy it ? Well, it highly depends on what you're looking for. If it's modern AAA titles you're after, you're clearly in the wrong place. On the other hand, if you still have fond memories of old school brawlers like Sword of Sodan and Barbarian II (the most obvious inspirations for this age of barbarian), you can hardly go wrong. It has everything you crave about pulp heroic fantasy : gore, more gore, women with dressing issues (less is better than more), cheesy voiceover (imagine a Z movie version of John Milius' ""Conan the barbarian""), tough fights, warriors, slaves, sceneries straight out of a Boris Vallejo work etc. You'll have to tolerate all the imperfections (and there's more than a few) but the ride though memory lane will be enjoyable.

"This game is a great time. If you enjoy Left 4 Dead versus, then prepare to take it up a few notches. I recommend going in blind and playing at least several rounds, there is so much tension and confusion that after 20 hours I am still on my toes constantly. You can never afford to be off guard, either because of SCPs or other enemy factions.  This game is simple, but its concepts are very well fleshed out. After becoming adjusted, objectives are clear. Gunplay is responsive, and requires varying levels of recoil management. This is definitely one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences I've played in a while, and requires exceptional team cooperation and coordination in order to survive. You will also have the chance to form alliances with some unexpected subjects, should you be convincing enough.  This game is primarily an escape/rescue game, where 2 separate factions are attempting to escape, and 2 other factions are attempting to rescue them with both of them attempting to stop each other. SCPs and the map are randomly chosen/generated every round, and rounds typically vary between 10-30 minutes. After the round is over, the victor is displayed, along with stats relevant to that faction. For example, if SCPs win stats such as total humans killed will be displayed. If Chaos wins, it will display the amount of personnel they rescued, along with other general stats. It's important to note that this game is entirely multiplayer, so if you have poor connection it will unfortunately be difficult to play this game. Although, servers are organized by region, making it easier to find a server that should work. On another note, I certainly appreciate that this is a free to play game that lacks any pay-to-win gimmicks or DLC at all. Though you can support them by donating, and this may be one of the only F2P's I have considered donating to. You just get the game, no strings attached and it's fantastic.  You may not be impressed visually or by animation, but the level design, gun mechanics, sound design, music, ambience, and concepts of the game will quickly help you move past what is superficial, and you will find a highly enjoyable, terrifying, exhilirating, and just downright fun experience that will keep you coming back for more again, and again, and again. This is not your typical team-based FPS. Just know this: Don't expect to survive. ",True,False

"Shadow of the Tomb Raider begins exactly at the point where Rise of the Tomb Raider ended. Lara Croft and Jonah Maiava leave Siberia and undertake the search for the Trinity in Cozumel, Mexico. It is a double mission; On the one hand, it is about making a discovery and on the other, solving the death of his father. And by the way, the first hour of play (which serves to familiarize us with the mechanics) is of brutal intensity. It is a kind of warning of what is coming to us: an adventure in capital letters, which does not break with the previous games, but manages to improve the formula in each of its aspects. It is incredible how deep Lara has gained in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. At this point we can think that we know everything about the character (that orphan aristocrat, who is dedicated to hunting ancient treasures around the world) but nuances have been introduced that finish forming him. After that memorable bonfire sequence in Tomb Raider (2013) in which she lamented her first death, we get to see how she transforms into a warrior and uses the environment to execute chilling attacks on her enemies. Similarly, she masters the techniques for moving through the jungle, hunting and exploring. On the opposite side, the character's vulnerabilities are very present. As in the previous two games, a glitch during certain game sequences can trigger the most horrible endings. It is just as shocking to see how she deals with the loss of innocents or loneliness. She is the most human Lara of the entire saga; she remembers her past, she has a relationship with Jonah beyond simple instructions and in general she builds the character in a more solid way. Shadow of the Tomb Raider does not stay there, and in a way turns the protagonist into a villain as well. Firstly, because when picking up Chak Chel's key, a ceremonial knife, Lara is the one who unleashes the Mayan apocalypse and secondly, because as she runs to save the world she experiences a ""descent into hell"" that brings out her most wild. Finally, what ends up drawing the character is the presence of a rival at the height. Dr. Dominguez is an expert in pre-Columbian civilizations who directs several excavations for La Trinidad and whom we have known since the beginning of the game. It is not a classic ""bad"", but a perfect counterpoint to this adventure. The exploration, hunting and climbing (using ice axes and rope, in addition to crampons to climb overhead walls) flow, and make us feel like the true lords of the jungle. On this occasion the underwater parts and the presence of temples, pyramids and tombs play a greater role. Precisely the tombs, which hid some of the best puzzles in the previous installments, but were optional, now appear integrated into the development. Until Shadow of the Tomb Raider arrived, combat skills had not played such a relevant role. It may seem exaggerated, but believe me when I say that Lara has become a killing machine, which the mercenaries of Dominguez fear. In addition to using the bow to execute silent attacks, we have a knife that allows us to silence the guards without being detected. Stealth is highly rewarded, and for this Lara is able to hide in the vegetation, climb the branches of trees, attack from the water and smear herself with mud to go unnoticed on the walls covered with vines. If we are not so patient and prefer direct confrontation, a system of shots with coverage has also been implemented, which however does not turn out to be so precise. To close this analysis, the camera also plays a dramatic role, particularly with the closest approaches, when taking air to breathe in a cave or when passing through the narrowest tunnels. And the animations, the soundtrack and the dubbing into Spanish (Lara's voice changed) finish off an excellent finish. Finally, we are facing a perfect ending to the trilogy of the new Lara Croft. Shadow of the Tomb Raider has the most ambitious story, the most vibrant moments, a deeper combat system, and the most exotic environments. We can only blame him for a slightly short duration.

"An excellent game completely recommended for those who are still in doubt due to the analysis. It is true that there are still things to improve but lately many of these have been corrected and now it is fully playable, the new Revisualized update left the game with incredible graphics, the Popping and AI ETC were corrected. Some things still need to be improved, such as making it lighter in the start menu since sometimes it has you waiting for a while, also a thousand thousand optimization in general In conclusion I recommend this game for the effort that I see that the developers put in it so yes continue like this the game will improve a lot in the next versions.

"Lemme say that this game is a bloody steal. From what i heard, this game is a port of a mobile version and so far it is a great port.  this game usually has 3 lanes in a track where you can switch with either the arrow keys or wasd keys. there are many stages to unlock, some of which are visually appealing while others are like someone flashing a floodlight in your face. this game does not allow you to drive your car in complete freedom, like audiio surf, it sticks to 3\ sometimes 4 lanes where you have to collect beats and avoid the hazzards. the game has 3 difficulties; Normal, Zen, and Hard. normal and hard are the same thing except hard only gives you one life. Zen completely removes the hazzards on the track and only leaves the beats. the game has MANY iconic cars from movies and you can customize the color of the body n rims.  Music works great on this game because the track follows the beat of the song and changes speeds depending on the tempo. my only complain is that some tracks are easier to see through when going over a hill than others, this creates problems for those who want to get a perfect run in some stages. what this game needs is the addition of leaderboards to give players more motivation to play for top spot on thier favriote song. Overall for its price, it is very much worth it. ",True,False

"First I bought it as a gift for a friend. He kept talking about how great this game was. That's when I wanted to see, what this was all about. Playing this game for only a few minutes, I was hooked and quickly bought all the DLC's that were available. The graphics, story, gameplay and the characters are overwhelming. Many funny, sad, exciting well made missions await you- to a point, where you don't want to continue with the main mission, so you don't miss some of the countless side missions that are all over the map. With a world bigger than GTA V in a beautiful setting and a well explained backstory with seemingly endless monster nests to destroy, bounty to find, caves to explore and missions to complete is something truly magnificent. Different outcomes from missions, that are based on the choices you made, guarantee an interesting replay, if you decide to start all over again. A very well deserved thumbs up and 10/10.

"I don't know why this game has mixed reviews, because in my opinion, this is a worthy continuation of the series. They say there was a bug with the complexity of the game, maybe that's why. But now it is quite a playable game in which you can even have a lot of fun. There are small bugs, but not critical ones. The game has not been played to the end yet, so the review may change in the future. We play for the forces of evil (), do evil deeds and take revenge on the forces of light. In addition to the main storyline, there are side quests that you do not have to take and complete, but they will help in pumping (more about it below). The game has humor,. We can run around the world, explore it, complete quests, fight ... Maybe it looks familiar, but it's interesting. A world with its own surprises, a lot of types of enemies, humorous quests (), research, pumping, trade. Personally, I like it, even though I'm not a fan of grind.

"Normally I don't write reviews but I have to give my mustard for this game;) First note: I received the game in the sale but even without it I would give a clear purchase recommendation. Why is? Domina is a ludus simulator in the style of the ""Spartacus"" series and does it justice. Bugs: Except for one crash, I can't find any bugs and since this occurs more often with AAA titles than here, a definite GO! Pros: - The fights are extremely funny even if they are fought out pretty quickly by the AI ​​and can therefore be over pretty quickly :) - The soundtrack is awesome and for the first time tempted me to buy it as a DLC in retrospect. - The events that come in the meantime are entertaining and actually ""RNG"": D - The ""Spartacus"" feeling comes up 1: 1 - The game can be extremely demanding in higher levels of difficulty if you are aiming to win the last tournament or all Receive achievements. Cons: - At the top of the negative side is the often missing explanation of certain mechanics, so here are some tips that I had to laboriously collect from several forums: => The ""Surrender"" minigame can be won easily if you don't just click the left mouse button hammers but also the right mouse button at the same time, press the space bar + A + D => If you want to survive the last event you have to give gladiators freedom during the course of the game, because they then rush to your aid. That also makes the difficulty, because you have to do without your ""champions"" in the process. For me it has proven to be worthwhile to send half of them to high-level gladis out into the big wide world just before the end. => The stat ""AI"" is the effectiveness with which the AI ​​fights the gladiators. This should first be brought to 100 and only then the remaining stats, because: The AI ​​always fights better than you: D => Proven employees: blacksmith (for car upgrades + car repairs), architect (for training extensions for gladiators ) & Bard (for increased morale - this increases the values ​​of the gladiators again) => The pit fights are totally RNG and can quickly lead to the death of the gladiators if you have not researched the skill that all below 10% HP automatically hum. But also a good source of money;) => For the success ""Gravitas"" you have to get a behemoth (boss from the 9 arena events) (also by chance) and then control it yourself with Mindcontrol. Opponents can be thrown on ""F"" - do this until the opponent dies and you are sure of success - Another contra are somehow the random events - these are very varied and therefore also on the pro side, but some decisions that you have to meet are almost proverbial between plague and cholera. If I take option A I lose on one side, if I take B I lose on the other and if I take option C I lose on both. However, you can probably say: That's life :) Overall, I still recommend a clear purchase. For the price, I've had more fun now than with some big titles that got bored after a few hours. Thumbs up!

"Ignoring my hours, I've played this game for much longer, i would definitely recommend this game.  Before playing the game though, download the unofficial patch of the internet and install it, they're guides on steam and the internet to do it correctly. You will want to install it before you make a save, because if you make a save before hand it will have errors and bugs such as missing assets when you play with the patch, so keep that in-mind.  The game's story and atmosphere is one of my favourites, most games bore me with the dialogue and atmosphere but this game does it extremely well.  The quests and characters are also amazing, the quests are very different and have multiple ways to complete them, depending on clan and skills you use, which makes the game re-playable. The characters have different and interesting personalities, and usually always have a large reason for being in the plot or link up somehow.  The voice acting is also very good, especially due to the fact that the game released in 2004.  The graphics show their age, and the combat is clunky and quite bad, and while that may put you off, i would still recommend getting the game for everything else.

"Intro/Back -Story Hideo Kojima is a Japanese video game designer, director, producer and writer. In 2005, Kojima founded Kojima Productions, a software house controlled by Konami, and by 2011, he was appointed vice president of Konami Digital Entertainment. In 2015, Kojima Productions split from Konami, becoming an independent studio. Their first game was Death Stranding, which released in 2019. I have a PS4 Pro but never picked up Death Stranding, early on I had tried out the Metal Gear Solid series on PS1 to PS3 with mixed results, some games I loved some not so much, still I found Hideo's touch very interesting. Fast forward to 2020 and extra free time thanks to the Pandemic, I decided to pick up Death Stranding on Steam, having watched a ton of videos and reading articles/reviews I knew I was getting into something completely different. At first it took awhile to come to terms with all I needed to learn about, but slowly I started understanding the whole picture. This games is all about the story and Kojima's vision of how it should be told and it's brilliant. You can rush through the story quests (orders for Sam) and be done in as little as 30-40 hours but what a waste that would be. There is so much more to do from crafting weapons, armor, motorcycles, trucks, stations etc.. it's a long list. Standard orders besides regular rewards build trust with different outposts on the UCA and unlock cosmetic upgrades and more. There is a huge cast of characters with a lot being real actors or personalities making it feel super epic. It's not multiplayer in the traditional way, more like you can like what different players bring to the world, something benefiting all players and they can do the same for you. If you think this is a walking sim you need to dive more into story mode (orders for Sam). This is all about the story everything else is just great filler rounding out one of the best open world game experiences of my life. Hideo Kojima is a genius, thank you for making this treasure.

During the passage, we not only strive to see what will happen next, but also learn facts from the biographies of the heroes. The plot rolls slowly, allowing you to savor every moment of being in Los Santos. At first, the tasks surprise with their innocence and variety: ride bicycles with Michael's son, sit in a difficult pose during a yoga session. Some quests show completely unexpected scenes. So, one day Franklin, moonlighting in the role of paparazzi, catches a socialite doing obscenities with some guy.

It mostly boils down to turn left, turn right or jump your way through each level with the main objective being do not hit anything. Sounds stupidily easy right. Keep thinking that until you reach the higher levels and try apocalypse mode.  For me this is not a play it all day kinda game. It's play it every single day an hour in the morning and/or an hour before bed to relax fly around, test my reflexes and try to beat the highscores set by the mammals on the leaderboard. This game has grown a lot and evolved over the years in to what it is today... a badass little game that deserves more attention that it gets.

"* The game i played was supplied by developer*  well what to say what to say?  ----- pros  - surprisingly deep - a lot of creative freedom _charming graphics  -------- cons  - not very noob friendly  - unforgiving - no real animation  Well when you first start the game you are presented with a blank patch of sea, what you do from here is shape your island. To shape your island you use mana, this mana replenishes over time (or as far as i can tell it does it seems very inconsistent). But i will return to mana later in the review. Starting with the good, the game offers you complete creative freedom in how your island is shaped where things are placed,and how big your population can get.  But mana is depleted with every tile of land you add. On every tile there will randomly be coal iron trees or a chicken. These are but a few of the resources you will use. Over all i think the mana for land situation is pretty good because as your population grows,and your production power as does your land mass. Because of this creativity steam sharing to share islands would be amazing. When you first start the game you really don't have much control, and this is jarring. In all honesty for the first 20  minutes it felt like i could do nothing to affect my creation. But after discovering the other mana ability aura, which allows you to lead your people for 10 seconds at the cost of 10 mana. When i first started playing i hated this but now i see that it does add strategy and depth of resource management, but i still am not a fan of having the cost be that high.  The graphics are cute and simplistic, very minimalist. Over all i like them they fit the situation. But animation is pretty much non existent. When you collect any resources you just walk by i would like at least a pick up animation.  But even without it will suffice. There is no tutorial in this game. There are not any hints on how to acquire materials or what order is recommended. To add to this to increase or resupply your population you need a male and female if all of one gender dies there is currently no way to get that gender back, So that is a literal death sentence for that save. Even placing your buildings in the wrong order can cause restart after restart.  over all 7/10 i will be coming back to this one ",True,True

"You'll probably know the story of Lucius if you consider to buy this demake version. But anyways you get born on a stormy day on the 6th of June 1966 as the son of Satan and you have to kill literally everyone who lives or works in your family home. The game contains 18 chapters in which you have to solve some not that hard riddles and finally kill the people by manipulating objects, controlling minds, or just kill them with fire. There are also some ""sidequests"" which allow you to unlock items that will give you hints every chapter. It took me about 3-4 hours to complete the game. Movement is achieved through the arrow keys instead of using the standard wasd-controlls which is no problem at all because a mouse is not needed for playing the game. One can access the special abilities with the keys from 1 to 5, Q for the diary, W for mounting the tricycle, E for the inventory, TAB for switching through targets and F for the flashlight. These controlls seem pretty inconvenient which they are in the beginning but you will figure this out quite fast. If you wish you can also use a gamepad (I noticed that after my first playthrough...) which makes it way more convenient to play. The C64 artstyle and the 8-bit soundtrack (actually I am not sure if it's 8-bit) harmonize well together and makes the game very enjoyable. The game's system requirements are that low that everyone expect it to run well which it did for me. I did not experience any crashes or bugs. I desperately recommend the game for those who: (I am sorry for grammatical and orthographical mistakes. English is not my native language.) ",True,False

"threw one molotov next thing I know Africa is on fire. 10/10 (old review)  {Please work with me as I go out of order in events because that's how it's going through my mind as I write this.} Where to begin with such a great game? You could start anywhere really, the setting is in Africa, you enter the country (I forget if they say. [yes I know Africa is a continent]) hunting a man known as ''The Jackal'' an arms dealer and your mission is to eliminate him; to stop the gun trafficking in the war torn country, but things turn down south immediatly after your boots touch the ground you've gotten malaria (This... This was one of the annoying/funny things I found that happen in the game, I mean c'mon it's freaking Malaria no one really wants to black out in the middle of a gun fight, I mean when I did I kept screaming ''♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥! Not now! Surely I have one more pill to keep me going!'' But alas I didn't and woke up a day later in a church now angry about the travel time I have to ensue yet again.) I digress through the events of the game you find new friends, new enemies, and many plot twist with these characters, and the currency in this game is Blood Diamonds which you find all across the map and from completing missions. If you read my little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review from the beginning you'd understand what I mean, it's pretty ridiculous, what starts as a little fire now consumes your entire screen. Now then the combat in this game I thought was pretty well for this game because there was a lot of realism for the time for example your gun would jam and you'd have to unjam it in the middle of a firefight (now you could avoid this altogether by getting a new version of the gun from your gun stash) or you'd find enemies weapons that are so rusty that litterally sometimes after 5-6 shots after you picking it up it just keeps jamming up and you scream ''WTF'' (you will do this trust me). Let me think ah yes! The RPG's in the game quite fun instruments, but just as dangerous! You could shoot a dud and then be like me and run away screaming or sit there like an idiot... Your call... the other thing it would do is start you on fire and you can easily put it out by using the healing animation. Now then moving on to Multiplayer... Just wow the creativity of people's imagination just blew me away! People were creating maps such as D-day with such realism you could look into a history book and it look the same, I always loved those kind of people when it comes to games where you can create such things, I certainly wish I could have that kind ability or at least a little bit of it haha. Onwards we go though, the multiplayer back then was pretty fun people were nice and they also very team play coordinated (which I love in team based games instead of lone wolves {which can work depending on the game and game modes} and I don't know how it is now since I haven't played multiplayer again yet due to playing with friends with other games.  Finally my score of the game: 10/10 still. I enjoyed litterally every part of the game, the characters, the story, the twists, and also being able to find some crazy ♥♥♥♥ that goes on in here.

"My adventure with the series began with the first part in probably 2012. I remember that back then I was delighted with this game and I was hooked on it for a really long time. Then there was a hiatus, now in 2019 the spirit of my ex-El Presidente has spoken and made me buy the game and I must admit that I got hooked again. The game doesn't offer many new features [apart from adding a community workshop], but I didn't expect it to be any more. On the other hand, the game deserves a big plus for optimizations and the interface because Tropico 1 has changed for a really better one. It is clearer and more pleasing to the eye. Unnecessary indicators were also removed or given a specific place. The second important thing is that from now on we know the exact size of our army because from now we know how many units we have due to the fact that certain military buildings provide us with a certain number of units, for example if we build barracks, after building them, the ranks of our army will increase by one an infantry squad, while the military base will provide us with a tank squad after building it. The last significant change is the resource management. Because it is not like in Tropico 1 where the deposits of, for example, uranium or gold were underground and we could build mines, now fossil deposits are located in caves and the only raw material of this type that is extracted unchanged is crude oil. Therefore, I believe that the game is worth buying and will draw the owner for hours. It also offers a new type of gameplay for the series, i.e. multiplayer, so it's really worth buying. IT WILL WORK EVEN ON THE WORST LAPTOP;] ",True,False

"There is a legend, but not from the book Already completely unknown. About one stalker, kid. With which there was no problem. There was one stalker who was experienced. He saw a lot, knew a lot And his groups knew him, He often helped many. He knew loopholes, secrets, paths And he could always lead, Where the guide could not ... He knew a lot of roads. And stepping to the anomalies He found artifacts. And carefully removing, Then he dragged them to the merchants. And he always knew how to get out of not weak scrapes. And mind you, not everyone had such a talent in themselves. Once he was in an open field A strong blow fell. But he survived, and Chernobyl soon awarded Him with talent. Everyone knew about his kindness, In trouble he could always help. Everyone called him a falcon. That guy was normal. But soon trouble came to him, he was going to the Red Forest. After cleaning all the equipment, I took a shotgun, ""Vintar"", a sawn-off shotgun. It seemed that could have happened, After all, he is resourceful and smart. But suddenly a crowd of animals began to converge on him from all sides. In a crowd of mutants, those shooting He went further and further into the forest. And without noticing it, He then disappeared forever. And few stalkers already know That moment is unkind, fatal. But the air from those times pierces From the forest a loud, eerie howl. Chernobyl gave the boy talent, But soon he took it away with life ... Whoever knew the guy firsthand, He grieved for a very long time.

"While I love this DLC a lot specially because it was a lot of fun for something that was really cheap (an even more for me as I got it when it had a big discount on top of the 50% discount I get on steam for being latinamerican), I do have some problems with it. Ok, first the good things. The DLC itself is so much fun, is FULL with new content and unlockables, like the Nyakuza jacket and tail, or the cat ears+mask replacement for the bombs, and not to mention the glorious ""Peace and Tranquility"" that will make all your problems just go away. And on top of that, this DLC also gives you the option to play it in groups of up to 50 players at the same time, which will just add to the fun. And now talking about the world itself, is so good and charming, full of wholesome moments just by listening to the NPCs or looking at the stuff on the world. It is also very massive and fun to explore as you unlock more and more sections of the city. And that's not even mentioning the music which is very good. But sadly the DLCs does have problems, the most noticeable of them being the poor optimization. The world as a whole runs very badly compared to the base game which was well optimized, but here you will drop frames conciderably, and in some sections like when you have to jump around a lot of trains your FPS will tank a LOT, really makes me feel sorry for anyone who has to play this game on an old PC or laptop. And the biggest disappointment would actually be the final level. Like, a level got me all pumped and ready to fight the final boss of the world, and as with the other worlds in the base game, they give you a Time Piece before the level where you have to fight the final boss. So when I went to select the next level, there were none... like, that's it?. Like, you reach the final boss and the DLC just ends abruptly, making you feel underwhelmed and wondering if there is more to it. Which means that the final level is just a ""Hey! remember some of the places you just went in the city?, so how about you go there again?"", what's even funnier is the fact that it has this tense music and the game makes it look like if you were in a rush, but in reality you can do it as slowly as possible and the game doesn't even punish you for doing so, and it the ""chase"" is filled with hearts so you can screw-up as badly as you can and you won't even lose. Also, don't get your hopes too high for the Storybook in the Time Rift of this DLC as it has nothing to do with the Nyakuza or boss itself, and is instead just the backstory of the little cleaning Rumbi you have in your ship. Overall, I would say that if you have the base game and you were wishing for more, buy this DLC if you see it in discount, otherwise just stick with the base game and try some workshop if you feel like it.

"Ghost Recon Wildlands is a game of Military Operation in Bolivia, which tells the conflict of the Ghosts against the super powerful drug cartel Santa Blanca, led by El Sueño and other influential personalities. Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands story is based on basically two points: Revenge and Power. After Agent Sandoval's death, the Ghosts team, led by Agent Bowman, is sent to Bolivia to investigate and destroy those responsible for the agent's death. In addition, the powerful Santa Blanca cartel is transforming Bolivia into a narco-state through absurd cocaine production. Santa Blanca can be subdivided into 04 operations: Security, Influence, Production and Traffic, each led by one You must collect information about the Operation to release the missions and thus destroy each one, killing or capturing each Despite to have a certain repetitiveness in some points, the game is not nauseating. It makes you feel angry, contempt and so many other feelings about what each one does to succeed in their operations. Gameplay is simple, with basically the same commands as any other third-person tactical game. The commands are very responsive and easy to be decorated. Of the 122 hours of the campaign, I played about 115 alone (the other 7 were with @ I KILL MY PEOPLE FOR DEMOCRACY addict: P) and the game was always fun. With a team of 4 Ghosts, you are responsible for leading them in all operations, talking about whether they should stand still, advance, shoot and when to perform the most outstanding skill, which is synchronized shooting. Simply spectacular. As I said several times, in my opinion, there is no one better than Ubisoft when it comes to setting. The map is gigantic, with several scenarios, such as deserts, snows, swamps, among others. In one place or another, we see textures of inferior quality, but it is nowhere near this incredible immensity created by Ubisoft. The optimization of the game is not spectacular. It is difficult for you to find a setting to keep the 60 fps stable. My tip: After the last update of February 2019, the normal Vsync gave a bug, which makes the frametime and framerate oscillate a lot. My way out was to turn on Fast Vsync, which made performance improve a lot, keeping everything very stable. I confess that I have had the game for a long time in my library, but that I waited to upgrade my machine to be able to enjoy this game in the best possible way, because it would be very heavy for my old processor. If you are one of those people who enjoy military operation games, surely Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands should be part of your game library, as he makes you feel like an operation.

But if you are patient you can play this game... have good music, the voice actors are good too and the controls isn't complicated... but if you wanna play the campaign you have to put effort on it, maybe the graphics isn't the best, but for an indie game is well made!

"Attempt # 1 In general, I ended up in this wonderful dark world and rushed as they say! First, I went to a town and there was a crowd of zombies. Then I bumped into a dude with an ax and I had no choice but to give the nix in the direction of the forest. When I realized that I got rid of the maniac, I stumbled upon the city and what do you think? Emptiness and nothing more. Hoping to find food and water went through all the houses and what do you think? There is no nikher. The next task was to find a weapon and what do you think? No, not this time I found what I was looking for. But my joy was not secretly long, as a fight with a dude who had a knife awaited me later. And what do you think? The bastard swayed. This is where the fun story ended. Attempt # 2 Here the game went completely differently. He was reborn somewhere in the forest and went straight to the view where the church was visible. I thought about getting there, but it wasn’t there !! I heard fierce battles around her. A crowd of beggars was still running past me and I was a friend talking into the microphone! So I believed them, but unfortunately there was no weapon, so I had to let my fellow travelers :) Then I came to some house and then I was covered with panic, because someone else came to it. Zashkerivshis around the corner waited until the uninvited guest dumped. It's good that he didn't see me :) Then, after running 200 meters, I came across a gas station and next to it a workshop. hoped to find at least something there and dick there. Then I found another house and what do you think? Some person is sitting on a sarter :) Well, I stumbled on him according to the precepts of Putin. Then I hobbled in the forest for a long time, found 30 pieces of berries in it and rushed back to look for the house. As a result, I found the Russians, who suddenly did not attack, but offered to unite into a group of survivors. Then another 4 people joined us, and we went on the road to look for a hut for building. But how hurt the bitch was when the game was kicked out !!! here my pukansky flew away.

"""Black Mirror"" appears from the first second like the adaptation of a real crime novel. Edgar A. Poe (certainly not the worst reference when it comes to scary stories) would certainly have enjoyed this gloomy scenario. The oppressive environment is presented so coherently that you can almost feel the atmosphere with your hands. Again the gamer is tempted to change his panties. Various factors contribute to this: In addition to the incredibly exciting and gripping story, the stylish graphics and the unprecedented German synchronization, it is above all the striking and no less eerie characters that Samuel meets during his investigations. All those involved seem authentically drawn throughout, which is mainly thanks to the professional voice actors who meticulously set every sentence to music. Black Mirror is without hesitation as one of the front runners in the point'n click genre. The developer dtp has created a really exciting and complex crime thriller that doesn't even need to hide 14 years after its release. ",True,False

"First of all: what is Ark anyway? It's a game in which you have to survive on different maps or arks. Dinosaurs can help you, from the dodo to the Giganotosaurus, which you tame with your tribe (tribe) consisting of other survivors or alone in long processes. With them and huge bases together, you can prove yourself with your friends against other tribes or bosses in big battles. Ark is one of the few games that really grab you, won't let you go and is still great fun even after hundreds / thousands of hours. In order to get to normal or only slightly increased settings, to large scores, a big grind is necessary, due to a large variety and fellow players, but only half as bad. The fights with other tribes are just great, even if it can be depressing with bigger losses. Due to the sandbox, the many different possibilities and the infinite additional content through Mods / Dlc`s, Ark never gets boring. The game has very good mechanics and is not as buggy as some current Triple A titles. However, the optimization leaves something to be desired, which is why a really high FPS number can hardly be achieved even with very good PC systems or a relatively good PC system is necessary to be able to enjoy Ark smoothly. (I myself played hundreds of hours on a laptop with which I could reach 10Fps, if at all). There is also an interesting story, even if for me, as well as for most other players, it is only fully understandable through a comprehensive Yt video, as it is written down in small parts on so-called explorer notes that can be found on the whole map are. Conclusion: Ark: Survival Evolved is always a breathtaking game even after the years. Anyone who is excited about a great survival game with a huge sandbox will have fun with Ark. Right now at the Summersale where Ark is available for 10 €, it is still worth buying this game. Personally, I would buy it again and again. ",True,False

You go to a server and watch the players on that server with Shift + Tab and it's just fucked up.

But as soon as you have the necessary basic knowledge, it quickly becomes fun, especially when you are out with 1-3 friends and the galaxy is unsafe;). I myself mostly traded during the season was simply more lucrative than transporting people, especially since they still had 1 - 2 other destinations where they wanted to go. on the way you meet pirates who want to relieve you of the load, but as an experienced pilot you shouldn't have a problem. I haven't dealt much with mining, you have a really big ship and you can usually defend yourself badly with a teammate of course quite entertaining. I got a Voiceattack with several language variants for the game (Eva - Aurora). This program listens to my voice commands and implements them (e.g. when I said “Aurora”, ship replied “yes, captain” then as a further command I said “full impulse” the ship confirms the statement, repeats them and carries out the action a macro, of course). also has its advantages when you are in combat and you wanted to switch your energy to weapons or shields you no longer had to look for the many keys but simply say it.

"After playing this game for over 800 hours, I think it's time for a little review. If someone ask me: ""Why do you play that game for that long time?"" I know the answer. Beside the fact, that the developer Overkill, is always adding new stuff (some for free, some as DLC), the levels are not the same. If you think you know how to gon, suddenly the cam room, which you want to take over is on another positon or the is suddenly a guard, which there was never before. Ok, after 800 hours I think I can say, that I know each possibilty from each level, but to solve a level even better and more efficiently then the last time, let me be motivated. In most level you have 2 generally ways: Loud or Stealth. So you have to decide with your group, which style you prefer and then: Sneak in, or strom the front! I always prefer the stealth way, but if it goes wrong, its fun to kill these huge amount of police which comes. To be  honest: Don't play this game with stranger guys. Instead of that, search at least 3 friends which also have that game, start a voicechat conference and then start. So far, my experience says: Yes, all levels are possible with random guys, but the best solution and the most fun, you'll get playing with 3 friends, regardless of stealthing or shooting.

"Wonderful!!!  + true sandbox  + automatic workforce  + funny + intuitive  - 'bad' research tree  - stale endgame  - priorities could be better  - awful maintenance  The game starts near perfect! You receive alot of freedom, true to a sandbox game. The tutorial gently introduces the information, without impeding gameplay. Building the required workstations and creating construction plans for goods is enough to set the workers off to work.  I was deeply delighted by the early game! But then, the game slows down, sometimes even clogs up. There are two main reasons for this: - the workstations follow the priority list to the letter, but that's not always the best coarse of action. For instance, if you have a long production plan, a short new one will wait for the long one. This could be remedied by holding the orders until every previous step starts production. Now in practice you solve this issue by having loads of stations and small orders. But endgame should be macro, not micro.  - maintenance... Workers rather idle around over repairing workstations. There is a research item that specialises runners into mechanics, but they don't seem to work either as I intended. So... yeah...  Speaking of the research tree, it's a mess... After I finished all points, I found the second page! And for the longest time my 'story' didn't progress, because I didn't put any points in plastic, oops!  Another factor in slowing down the game is how the design plans work. Initially, with small products, it gives a good overview of the components. But with bigger designs it becomes a bit messy. Especially when a future model has higher requirements, you can either find a weak point in the design, and amend it. But sometimes that's as much work as making a new design. It could also be done via prompts, one by one every ingredient and workstation, or by simply setting desired stats. This could be done by research, even by creating a planning office.  The achievements can be completed with any 1 factory, and that's something I really appreciate.  Despite my critique I do love this game! At some point I will check DLC for sure, maybe next Halloween. I hope the devs will make more factory games in the future! Preferably more realistic, but I know cartoony just sells better.

"Before I finally got around to playing Undertale a few weeks ago, I figured it was overrated--no game could possibly merit the hype that this one got.  When I finished the True Pacifist run a few days later, I reckoned that I was right, but only in the sense that a game like Portal 2 or Fallout is overrated.  Undertale is probably one of the best Eastern-style RPGs I've ever played--in terms of quality-per-hour, I'd have no problem putting it in the same ranks as Chrono Trigger, and it's a hell of a lot better than its primary inspiration, Earthbound. If I were to name only one reason to play this game that doesn't even get into specifics of mechanics or plot, it would be the reason I nominated it for the 2017 ""Choices Matter"" Steam Award.  In most games that have moral choices, the choices only affect relatively minor elements such as the types of powers you get and some ways in which other characters react to you.  The best you can usually hope for is a different ending.  But Undertale has the best linkage between morality and gameplay that I've seen since Ultima IV.  For a lot of greybearded gamers out there, that sentence alone should be enough to get you intrigued.  For the rest of you, what I mean to say is that playing Undertale as a good guy is almost a completely different experience from playing it as a bad guy, so much so that I think you have to play it as both to gain a true understanding of the game and the message that Toby Fox was trying to convey with it. I'm not going to say any more than that not only because this is a particularly bad game to spoil, but because anything else is truly unnecessary.  If the above sounds even remotely interesting to you, then I urge you to give Undertale a try. ",True,False

"I was playing nostalgic games from my old home computer because my computer was broken. I said I would also install Postal. When I first opened the game, the main menu, the music, the look and the sounds scare me. Human ""I wonder if I got a lousy horror game?"" he thinks. When you start a new game, you cannot get used to the controls first; mouse control sucks, the keys are the classic postal keys, but the game's perspective is different so you are confused where to go and what to do. Maybe it would have been better if there had been an update for the controls because we shoot with ctrl instead of left click. It is a fully keyboard game. We are killing the city in the game, this is the missions. If you want, you can kill the whole city, if you want, you can kill the number of people you specified. You can see naked people in the last 2 maps, but I can't see it because I haven't played well enough to get to the last maps. Half of the achievements are easy to earn, you have to give the game a few more hours to win the other half. You can try it if you are a success hunter, I have very difficult 1-2 achievements. Since I have dropped and sold the trading cards in advance, I cannot say anything, but a card is a card. Have you had a rough and awful day?

"In this game, I still have few hours, but I want to say that despite this, the game is very loyal and pleasant to the beginner, I literally learned to dodge not badly in 30 hours, but players in the CIS will most likely have a large ping (according to at least my friends and I have a ping of 89-100) and because of this there is a possibility that a person with a good pingm will reach you through the wall, but believe me, this is the only drawback of the majority. if played with friends, it is incredibly fun game.

"This is exactly what Bethesda should have thought of before trying to bring Doom 3 closer to the drive of the first Doom. Doom 3 is a wonderful horror game, with its own madness, but original mechanics, where you choose to shine a flashlight or fire a jig (mansevate / dodge - author's note) and recklessly empty the clip into pitch darkness. In Doom 3 BFG Edition, the mechanics were changed, along the way some organs were sawed off. Vital, I believe. But more on that later. From now on, the lantern is attached to the armor (and crookedly, you can see it in the reflections in the mirror) and has an automatically replenished charge (the dream of all Yablofon users). It still pisses me off, albeit in a slightly different way. Why did the Gazebo do this? To sell the game to more players. In theory, this should make the game more agile and energetic, bringing back the spirit of true Doom. But in practice it turned out, well, let's say, so-so. ... Oh yes, they screwed the flashlight to the shooting, but at that they clapped their hands and pulled down their sleeves. But in the game there are many moments tied exactly to the old mechanics. For example, a level in hell, where all weapons and a flashlight are taken away from you, or with areas where your lighting device is cut off by an impulse and either an NPC or a bulb with a demon illuminates your path. Instead of pressing against a light source, you run like crazy, illuminating everything with your miracle flashlight, and enemies will spawn right in front of your nose. Meh. (applicable to both versions of Doom 3). Yes, unlike the first games, here it is deeper, wider and higher. Doom 3 is also a reboot. The new main character, the same silent infantryman, moderately brutal, but still humane. However, this part of the brutality is not at all to face. In some places we are shown cut-scenes and the GG's reactions in them. This is a pathetic word. A couple of times we are faced with a choice. This does not greatly affect the further passage, but still at least some kind of variability pleases. It feels like in the re-release it is shamelessly cut to the lowest, and in the game menu it is impossible to change or check anything. Added support for widescreen resolutions and soap level. All. But first we cut out dynamic lighting. Bravo. Then they swear that everything was returned. But if you compare both versions, then the original stands out strongly, in an advantageous way. Albeit low resolution textures. The game was already called a Half-Life clone, but BFG decided to go further and become a Half-Life clone. Additional levels in the face of Lost Mission do not improve the situation. Honestly, we would not have lost anything if they had remained lost further. Well, she is, but as if she is not. When the reissue came out, it was more or less lively there. At the moment, Thanos has happened to multiplayer. The first is Doom and Doom II: Hell on the Earth, albeit with shallow censorship and not the Ultimate and Final versions, respectively, but without dancing with a tambourine and DOSBox. The second is achievements, and for the first two dumas as well. The third is dynamics. Before us is a version for those who have not played the original and want to shoot more than constantly go around the dark corners. But, in my opinion, it's still better to buy Doom 2016 and not sweat it. The re-release tries to make the game more dynamic and offers the first two parts as a bonus, achievements, slightly improved textures and cut levels, while sacrificing atmosphere and shadows. I would still recommend the original, but who cares about my opinion? ",True,False

"Unlike others discussing, I still had a chance to play))) Even twice (I even took the top the first time)) Briefly - the graphics are a little better than shitty, the physics of the log in the bathroom, the control is clumsy, the ballistics - there are more or less lags and friezes - in I was not sure if it was due to ping, but rather due to extremely mediocre optimization (if it was there at all). and there are no special settings ... Regarding the gameplay - it is interesting and cheerful, the barrels of the norms, abilities and mechanics of pumping a car at the level (instead of a helmet and armor, there are several grades of suspension \ drive \ wheels \ frame, like weapons), online - it stupidly not, the modes are only solo and training, the units seem to be present, but inactive = \ There are even some seasonal rewards (seasonal level scale) and weak customization of all junk, in short, everything is according to the standard of the current royal battles All this mess weighs 20- 25 GB My verdict: the very idea and implementation of the gameplay is excellent, everything else leaves much to be desired and hangs somewhere at the level of 2000-2007, both in terms of graphonium and brick-like physics. I think, with due attention and fine-tuning, it will be quite popular, but now I do not advise downloading and trying to play, except to form my own opinion ",True,True

"С самого детства симуляторы ферм меня отталкивали, я проходила мимо «Веселой фермы» и её многочисленных клонов, отдавая предпочтения чему-то другому, но листая ленту steam я заметила одну игру про ферму, спросила друзей и прочла отзывы. Собравшись с духом, всё же решила приобрести, а в случае чего сделать возврат.  Вернула ли я деньги? Нет, к тому же я наиграла сотню часов, влюбилась в игру и забыла, что такое реальный мир, но обо всём по порядку.  Уставший от рутиной работы в офисе главный герои/героиня отправляются на ферму, которую завещал умерший дедушка, по приезду мы получаем заросший и убитый участок.  По ходу сюжета мы знакомимся с остальными жителями города, которых очень много и каждый из них имеет уникальный характер с предпочтениям, пытаемся привести ферму в нормальное состояние, а после нам дают на выбор главную цель игры (её можно не выполнять и просто наслаждаться крафтом): вернуть былой вид старому клубу, собирая узелки с уникальными предметами или сделать из него склад компаний, попутно собирая огромные суммы на реконструкцию тех или иных вещей.  Особо сюжета тут нет, хоть и имеется много кат-сцен с раскрытием характера, которые показывают событие жителей и как меняется их жизнь с нашим появлением. В «Stardew valley» невозможно ни заскучать, потому что тут есть море заданий и каждая вещь так или иначе выполняет функцию, чтобы игроку не было скучно.  В игре можно стать   и разводить растения (культур достаточно много и каждое растение требует своего особенного подхода), продавать и качать силы в этом направлении.  Можно заняться  : разводить кур, свиней, кроликов, коров и даже динозавров, а после из яиц или молока делать другие продукты питания. Самое не любимое и трудно для меня –  , ведь мини игра изрядно потрепала мне нервы и только после зимнего обновления с тренировочной удочкой, удалось прокачатся. Рыбу можно ловить где угодно и поимать совершенно разных (для каждой есть свое время и водоем), а потом её продавать. Не самое выгодное занятие, я ради узелка в клубе ловила рыбу. В долине есть   с   этажами, которая кишит монстрами, драгоценными камнями и кучей других полезных ископаемых. Маленький совет для начинающих: проходить по пять этажей за день, так шахта не сильно надоест и быстро поползете до дна. Так же в другой локации есть новая шахта с бо́льшим уровнем сложности.  Можно заняться  : рубить деревья, ломать камни, рвать траву и собирать все, что находите на земле. Очень лёгкая ветка навыка и качается быстро.  Если вам наскучит рутина, то можно   с жителями, подарить им подарок, а с некоторыми завести свою семью и детей. В игре отсутствует расизм и гомофобия, так что смело создавайте гей и лесби пары, даже детей усыновить можно без проблем. Тут даже можно научиться   для себя, жителей или супруга.   «Stardew valley» и правда не даёт заскучать долгие часы, хоть и к сотни часов (примерно 3,5 год игры) моя игра доведена до автоматизма. Утренний подъем, приветствие с мужем и детьми, проверка погреба, после поливаю грядки, до которых не доходит автополив, обнимашки с живностью, а потом сбор ресурсов и заправка машин для майонеза/шерсти/сыра/масла, после я шла смотреть, что в теплице, проверяла корм в авто-кормушке, наполняла ловушки для раков, собирала фрукты и урожай, а после бежала в шахту/на рыбалку/общалась с жителями/выполняла поручения с доски заданий, а под вечер сидела в пабе с жителями и угощала едой. В этом была своя атмосфера.  что каждый день ограничен временем (примерно 13 минут), ваша живность может перестать давать ресурсы, если её не кормить, жители обидятся, если подарить плохой подарок, а растения зачахнуть или их съедят вороны. Не стоит ожидать шикарной графики, это пиксельная игра на 300 мб с атмосферной музыкой для каждого сезона, анимацией для растении, милых звуков и приятными жителями.  Можно не торопливо заниматься своими делами и наслаждаться игрой.  Многим за это и нравится «stardew valley», она пленит своей медленной и тягучей, подобно меду, атмосферой, которая захватывает игроков на долгое время и ты не замечаешь, как ведь день кормил курочек или собирал клубнику.  В долине четыре сезона по 28 дней, где в определенный день проходят праздники, чьи-то дни рождения или ярмарка. Погода меняется, как и окружение игры вместе с музыкой, но к сожалению не одежда персонажей.    «Stardew valley» шикарная игра, которая стоит каждой копейки, ведь в ней столько контента и тонкостей (подарки жителям, отношения, погода, растения, животные – требуют свои подход), что я за сотню часов изучила примерно 80% и так и не дошла до финала. Разработчики обновляют игру и добавляют в неё море новых плюшек, кат-сцен, поручении и вещей.  В игре есть   на четверых человек, где вы вместе можете выращивать овощи, кормить коров и бить монстров в шахтах (только бюджет делайте не общим, а то один раз мои товарищ по игре продал и тут же купит меч, потеряв при этом 1000 монет и лишил меня денег на семена, хех). Это тот тип игры, где после рабочего дня можно спокойно расслабится и не думать о жестокостях в своей уютной ферме рядом с любимым пиксельным супругом, молчаливыми детьми и мурчащим животным на кровати. Хочется завернуться, как рулет в эту игру и никогда с него не выходить.",True,False
"This game is not called Syndicate. But that's exactly how it feels! It was directed by Mike Diskett, who was involved as producer and chief programmer in Syndicate Wars, the successor to the great classic. Satellite Reign is a strategy game in an open-world cyberpunk city in which the player - similar to Syndicate from 1993 - commands a team of four agents of different classes from a bird's eye view. Huge megacorporations rule the world, and it is up to the player whether to free humanity from their yoke or to usurp power itself. The procedure is flexible - it is possible to fight opponents with armed force, to hack into their computer systems without being noticed or to switch off their infrastructure. Again and again it happens that your squad fails shortly before the goal and has to start the job from the beginning - see Syndicate. Because saving in the middle of an enemy base is not possible.

The game has become worse in terms of the morality and humanity of the characters' actions ... There are unclear points and questions for the creators. For example, why kill Nick in such a stupid way ?! One could have come up with a more sub-grammatical ending for him. By the way, about the dramatism of it in the game will be enough throughout the game, there will be more experiences and there will be many sad situations.

"English ------------ Deutsch Deathrap doesn't seem very appealing at first sight, but so far it sure is the best Tower Defense I've ever played. I'd describe it as a mixture between a Tower Defense like Orcs Must Die 2 and Dungeon Defenders and an Action/RPG like Diablo and Torchlight 2, in a much darker tone.

However, wandering in the past tense and the very interesting position of the US president of the protagonist give a completely different atmosphere, in contrast to the last 3 parts of the game. If, since the time of Part 2, the series of games has been compared to GTA, then now Saints Row can be called the gaming industry's own brand, nothing like the GTA and Mass Effect series.

"One Shot Three Kill A continuation and at the same time the third installment of the action game struggling with the life of a sniper, re-released by the Polish developer CI Games, where production costs reached as much as PLN 40 million. The place of action was planted in Georgia in an open world, in the realities of a local conflict, the Kremlin has become the main terrorist object in which we eliminate dangerous enemies behind enemy lines. Our main character, which we control, is Jonathan North. In addition to the main mission, our hero has his own case to find his younger brother in Georgian territory, we support the local resistance movement in exchange for information about his brother's place. The open world in the game is large enough to overcome the roads, the creators offered us the opportunity to explore the areas thanks to the vehicle that we drive through most of the game in order to find outposts and other key places, in addition to fast traversing, fast travel anywhere on the map can help us thus we will find such a travel point. The story missions are quite longer than their predecessors, and we perform side missions in various combat possibilities and we make our own decisions from three paths as a long-range sniper, as a ghost during silent elimination thanks to suppressed weapons and be a fighter by carrying out frontal attacks from a heavy arsenal. In the game, a skill system has been added to the three paths we will take, we will unlock helpful accessories for our sniper faster healing or more ammunition, but the creators at this point did not try too much and went the easy way. The weapon we have at our disposal is huge, there is a camera with a bullet as well as modifications in the workshop, adding silencers, creating cartridges, larger magazines, we unlock various sniper rifles with considerable recoil power, assault rifles that help in close combat with a large group of enemies and a reflex bow that we will get in one hidden cave, I recommend a shotgun for close range. We have everything available in one hideout from three individual maps, here we prepare everything before the mission, what we take with us and get to know the mission plan, in addition, we get orders to eliminate the most dangerous criminals sought, for which we get interesting money loot. For extreme navigation conditions, we have been equipped with a sense of a scout on the basis of a detective mode, finding traces and a drone that helps us find enemies by tracking them and showing the right path, in addition, in Georgia, a few challenges with a drone are not enough, but a nice toy for finding interesting discoveries . The graphics work on a modified CryEngine graphics engine, using the potential of our computer configuration, we will be satisfied with the maximum graphics settings from the beautiful mountains in Georgia with a daily cycle and the sunset weather, in technical matters the game can sometimes throw us to the desktop, but the optimization has been very well improved .

"After enjoying the adorable Shiba Inu in Montaro, this clever dog returns once again to explore a new setting while casually pulling up panties. Although unfortunately on the latter, in this installment we have no life points and we do not get a ""panties collector"" as in the first, a point in my opinion negative because it is part of the charm of the first. Removing this, there are no major changes from the first installment except for new costumes, a new enemy, and small variations from the new one. It also changes the scene and, in my opinion, getting all the achievements is much easier. Do I recommend Montaro RE?

"Very cute click game. You collect fruits and vegetables, receive money and can use them to buy more plants and various upgrades. At some point it will be a real bustle :). Sometimes it continues even if you are not playing, the little helpers continue to harvest (can be increased) and you can then simply pick up the money the next time you start the game. There are also different ""opponents"" who steal your harvest in different ways. You can protect yourself against this with upgrades, items and animals. If you are looking for cute graphics and a game that you only play a few minutes a day, I recommend this. The price is perfectly fine.

"The game rly impressed with the atmospheric art-style and a ton of fish(The Unreal Engine does something beautiful here). The gameplay is not that impressive, but it's not  a reason why somebody shouldn't play the game also the note to play it without a keyboard is actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's rly easy to play it with a keyboard. The biggest Problem the game has is the the fact that it is just 2 hours long what is damn short for a 20€ game. I guess you can compare this game to The Beginners Guide, it's not rly long but still worth every second. The story is only a side thing and has without one moment nothing rly dramatic.

"Well, the final part of the trilogy ... Meet: ""Stalker: Call of Pripyat"" In my opinion, the best part of the whole trilogy is precisely ""Call of Pripyat"" ""Why, then"" - you ask. I'll answer you! Plot: Finally, something new was introduced into this plot, now the main character did not just come to Pripyat for artifacts or for a sarcophagus, but to find out what happened to the military and why the Forvator plan failed. And I'll tell you that they managed to give the franchise some fresh air. But all exactly they repeated the side quest as in their predecessors: Find / Kill / Bring. Graphics: Alas, they failed to do something new in terms of graphics, it is similar to its predecessors in terms of bushes, water, TS, etc. Gameplay: Fewer bugs, Fewer crashes, and thank God that they at least tried and made fewer crashes, otherwise I thought that this pain would not stop! And after all this you will ask me again ... Why is it the best, if the side missions are the same, the graphics are the same, the bugs are the same. I'll tell you this - ""This is the final part of this trilogy, and they did their best."" Yes ... Of course they could have done better, but thank God they did not fall face down in the mud, because if ""Call of Pripyat"" repeated: Plot, Graphics, Gameplay, like its predecessors, then it would be fucked up!

"Honestly if you don't have over 150+ hours in the game your review absolutely means nothing.  The game has so much potential.  I started the game off literally on some xcom ♥♥♥♥. What i found was a game that really lets you make a mage into a battle mage and into a brawler. With diverse customization like this, shiddd i could do anything.  IDK I'm just saying theres so much content. So many bosses, so many rare gear to get. SO MENY things this game is giving me that I want that I crave in a game.  God they even have a sniper ♥♥♥♥♥ who is A BEAST and tames them. Splits into Pokemon can now try to catch a legendary and make him strong as well.  Story?! It's dramatic af. A lot of ♥♥♥♥ goes down, and you will hate Sharky eventually. Also that bastard Immortal John. The game offers Cruel difficulty. It's pretty unforgiving with challenge mode, but the rewards are sweet. I'd save give it a try if you are a tactical game type guy, the battles can be down right brutal sometimes. Making you question why put yourself through this torture.  And then you beat it, you beat your first violent case on cruel with challenge mode. The sense of amazingness felt after finally doing it ugh.

"In my opinion, these words of the Lumen group best describe Chloe - the main character of Life is strange: Before the Storm. Together with her, we experience her youthful maximalism, the rebelliousness characteristic of all adolescents, we find the first true love forever, we discover new facets of human emotions and responsibility. Someone goes through this with her, but it reminded me of my dashing years in high school. Quest-like games rarely catch me alive, the last time it was Fahrenheit, if my memory serves me right, and the most amazing thing is that Shakespeare's Tempest was also mentioned there. But back to LiS: BtS, this game brought me back to the best years of my life, forced me to rediscover many human emotions forgotten in the routine of ""adult"" life. Like the Endless Summer, she awakened something bright and kind in me. It's almost impossible to squeeze a tear out of me, but this game still succeeded. Huge kudos to the developers for creating this atmospheric masterpiece. Yes, yes, it was a masterpiece - the first part was insanely good, but the opportunity to rewind the time completely killed the whole drama from a wrong decision. Here we can only come to terms with the consequences and try to somehow fix it in the future. The sterile cardboard Max from the first part was replaced by the living rebel Chloe and the excellent student Rachel, it is a pleasure to participate in the development of their relationship. Sending a dick to a stepfather and twirling social norms on all the details is even more pleasure, but what else is needed for happiness at 16?))) In general, once again, thanks to the developers for returning to youth, for the opportunity to relive all this again, for an emotional response of such strength that it still shakes me, although it has been the second day since the credits. I recommend it for mandatory passage. 12 angry lesbians out of 10. ZY So this game made me read Shakespeare's Tempest, I recommend it too.) ",True,False

They should also improve the microphone, to hear people lower if they are far or higher if they are close. Not everything is bad, its PVP is very good, the animations are spectacular, you can do parkour, for now people are not toxic with exceptions, quite a few crafters, the AI ​​is quite intelligent and things like all hardcore games are difficult to achieve, therefore it gives him more emotion the fact of having to leave a pistol for water on many occasions.

"When my old classmates and I Amway’s game, I really refused. From Arma 2’s mod to dayz to h1z1, I never liked this kind of game. I played csgo for nearly 4000 hours in silence. I said, “I’m going to death fight. I just fell asleep after playing.” One day I drank fake wine, drove the live broadcast room, and bought chicken. Since then, I haven’t played the csgo game again. It’s still a bit scared to have 80% of the above blind comments, so I still Let’s talk about the game-my homepage has a configuration so I am not stuck when I play it-but some time ago I went to the Internet cafe when I went to Dongguan classmates reunion-wow the highest configuration is e3v3+gtx960+8g+1080p-play it I can’t say that it’s cool, but I can accept it-well, after all, the four queuing friends fell into a box that night and the last three ate chickens-frame dropping and stuttering. In addition to the CPU and graphics card, it also depends on the speed of the hard disk, memory size and network conditions-recommended configuration I suggest you go to the graphics card-so many and so many people who have devoted themselves to the express business are enough to show that the game is good or not-now the peak number of players in steam statistics is 88w+ has surpassed dota2&csgo-what is the game playing? You will come to this store page, presumably You already know that-yes, it is to receive and deliver express delivery and occasionally eat chicken (non-existent)-of course, it is not ruled out that some people do not like this kind of game, after all, turnip cabbage-you can choose to be a LYB gou all the way-you can too Don’t try to eat chicken as the goal and persuade you everywhere (in fact, it was suggested in the early days)-find more people to practice the operation of the gun, such as body posture and pressure gun-this will improve your future game experience quickly ------ -------------------------------------- what?! Do you think that what you think is really an evaluation? Yes, this is not an evaluation, I just think the previous one is a bit short and now I want to lengthen it a little bit, so I said a little bit about the feeling of playing the game by myself.

"Doom, what can I say ... This game is simply F A N T A S T I Q U E! It's a doom, the story is rather light and does not last for ages, but then what a joy to be able to let off steam so much, that there is endlessly nagging combat as I like it. I am unfortunately too young to have known the first ones, but this one makes me dream ... I am the type of person who these days, has difficulty in hanging on to a game to the point of spending more than an hour above, here what happens is that I force myself to stop so as not to go crazy or go to bed at astronomical hours !!! In short, you will understand, Doom (4) goes straight to my heart, it is without any hesitation the best game I could buy on Steam ... (plus -50% during Bethesda sales! !) Important point too, the soundtrack is just CRAZY! It puts in trance and makes you want to fart endless creature heads, that with big speakers and good bass I am not telling you ...

In comparison my all time favorite and best Telltale game to date, The Wolf Among Us, is completely focused on playing as Wolf and Wolf alone, there's no character switching there. The game mechanics are simple and straightforward and there is no need for you to have played any of the other Borderland games: you can jump right in and start playing. Also worth mentioning (for those who care): this is a very easy game to get all achievements for so that your number of Perfect Games will be +1, just play the game until the end and that's it, no chapter replays needed and no secrets or hidden objects to search for.

"I played on Napoleonic_Role_Play server on the Island map. There was about 195-200 players. It was France vs United Kingdom.  I decided to become Napoleon - leader of cavalry (France) There was 5 artillery men, protected by 10 soldiers - to make sure it wont get easily killed by enemy. There was also about 15 cavalry (led by me) + 65 soldiers in 3 regiments. (led by officers) First regiment (16 soldiers + 3 sappers + 1 musician) decided to go to the red fort,make defences in there and wait for the enemy. Second regiment (23 soldiers + 2 musicians) decided to go to the white fort, which was the closest fort to the enemy spawn. Third regiment (20 soldiers) decided to go with first regiment and then they went to destroy enemy artillery. Musicians give boost to accuracy,reloading speed (defends from a type of musician) I decided to fight UK cavalry. There was about either 15 or 16 enemy cavalry. We fought nearby white fort,which was taken by UK. It was a mistake. We lost about 11 cavalry thanks to English infantry. Their cavalry was so weak. I mean hussars instead of using their good,fast horses, they ran away because they were probably scared of death Only 2 of UK cav. survived because they were cowards. In the meantime second regiment tried to fight the enemy in white fort. They would win, but UK got backup from artillery protection. No one survived. Everybody fought to the end. Thanks to that, third regiment had no problem with killing enemy artillery and then they went to the white fort. It was easier for them because they had us - cavalry. After that i saw that enemy had 2 regiments left.   First English regiment tried to get rid of our artillery Second English regiment tried to take red fort - taken by our first regiment. Thanks to help of our sappers - defences,barricades : French regiment won After that we all went to help our artillery. It wasn't so good back there - enemy had support of 2 stupid hussars who were cowards. Thanks to our Cavalry Shooters we managed to take out enemy cavalry. They tried to run away again. Even admin warned them that they will be slayed for delaying, but they didnt listen. There was only 1 guy who surrendered - enemy Admiral. Island map kinda sucked for him because he had no people in his regiment - it wasnt a water map. Most of people who become sailors in that map, they just troll others. We made a 2 firing lines: First line (18 soldiers) crouched  Second line (17 soldiers) stood still On my ""sword"" signal - they all shot him. Even musicians and sappers grabbed weapons from the ground and joined the lines too. And then . . . we won it. From 95 brave soldiers only 36 survived: Cavalry - 1 lancer without a horse + 2 Shooters + Napoleon (me) = 4  First regiment - 11 soldiers + 2 musicians + 1 sapper = 14 Second regiment - 0 Third regiment - 9 soldiers Artillery with protection - 3 artillery men + 6 soldiers = 9 This game is what you need to play: firing lines, regiments, musicians, surrender to get killed by next minute . . . The sad thing is that admins on Napoleonic_Role_Play server give rules, but from around 190-200 players only 10-20 of them care about it. Sad, but true. And then people get mad at admins for getting kicked, but its their fault that they didnt follow rules. There are bugs too, but they can be forgiven due to amount of epic moments (Cavalry charge, 100 vs 100 firing line etc.) 10/10  P.S. Happy Valentines Day ! ",True,False

"Today I come to rewrite the analysis of this wonderful game that has developed horrors since the last year of release ... Skullgirls is a 2D arcade-style fighting game with combos and everything, an excellent translation for PTBR and with a very interesting story (each character plays an important role in the plot as a whole), I think that all characters have a unique personality (so we’re very captivated by everyone) and that’s really cool! It's been a long time since I thought of a fighting game where I liked to play with EVERYONE. The animation work of the sprites is grade 10. Other than that, it is a game that doesn’t spend much on the PC and that has a really cool online multiplayer! (seriously, if you like to play fighting games online this game is one of those that are worth buying). Other good points: a) I tested several different Joysticks with this game and they work very well! (no more using just the xbox 360 joystick! My logitech thanks you) b) The game's producer kindly always makes the latest character released as a free DLC always available (for a period, then starts charging for them) c) if you like galleries of art with game content get ready, in skullgirls you really have a reason to keep zeroing the game, the arts are really cool, it has all kinds of traits and different styles and every time you reset the game (story mode / arcade mode) you will unlock some. d) (and not least) The game's BOSS (marie) really offers a very nice challenge, that is, even if you are very good, if you screw with it, you die. A perfect game in all aspects. 10/10! Especially, because it was done with a lot of dedication and affection by the gamers (who participated in the whole process). : D ",True,False

It's a great experience for those who loves horror games and of course a bit of a puzzle here and there... getting hunted by the half robotic enemies and a big angler fish in the abyss of the ocean. < S P O I L E R S > here is what i learned about SOMA -------->         SOMA is kind of a weird game to play and also tense when you are trying to hide for the creatures that is trying to kill you or... turn you into a something that you don't even want to see and the result is, that you will become one of the guys, that are stucked and their minds are empty, they don't can't even focus how to move or something. They just lay there and i still don't know what that means. The thing that i know is that you are some kind of a half human half robotic dude who just exploring the underworld such as the abyss and buildings in it... and yeah, about abyss that is in the game, for me abyss is very scary, i mean like it's just pitch black darkness ground of the ocean, and the sign that shows you ""STICK WITH THE LIGHT"" spooped me.... also about the darkness that is in the abyss, how about you see something that is coming out of nowhere with a light and has a fangs like a vampire right straight to you.... a damn angler fish, like for me its spooky >< Catherine helps you out on your journey and navigates you to the ARK where there are lost data of people who are tortured in the abyss...

"What can I say, I'm still a fan of the Deus Ex range from Deus Ex 1 on. Even if Deus Ex 2 was disappointing and Deus Ex: Human Revolution was better again but never got to 1. So I thought, take a look at Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. I don't want to say it's a bad game because at times I could hardly stop playing. However, the story itself never really got started. Now that I've come through, I have to say the story is extremely transparent. So from the first third I assumed who the villain was, and it was him too. There were mysterious clips and messages, but ultimately they weren't important to the story. It has turned to filler material. As for the game world, it seemed very inanimate to me. Admittedly, I can't remember exactly how animated the world was in Part 1, but one must not forget that there are over 15 years of technological development in between and that e.g. Mafia and GTA show how a game world can be animated. In Deus Ex Mankind Divided everything looks like it is on a theater stage - extras and stage sets. I still recommend the game, but not at full price! If you can shoot it later for 15-20 €, it is quite entertaining and, as I said in places, exciting. ",True,False

"Waking up on the shore and limping to the local research post (a terrace with a microscope and all sorts of flasks), I had to immerse myself in botany - the medicine will not find itself. There were not many plants in the area, so, stocking up on the created painkillers, I went north to scout the area. Found a piece of the map helped to navigate, but it was necessary to expand the territory. I climbed onto the rock to triangulate, but due to inertia I flew head over heels. When I fell, I dropped everything from my hands: the knife was lost in the stones, and the collected flowers flopped down next to me and looked at me with petals shimmering in the sun. My head was splitting, everything was floating, but the homemade pills helped to recover. I was lucky that I landed near the hut, inside on the table were fruit and a jug of water. Filling the flask, I took a breath as I read the passage of the diary I found. Strange symbols, cults? It looks like the plague is driving people crazy. I imagined what I would have to face if I continued to move deeper into the island ... Weapons would not have hurt, and even more so to gain strength and refresh myself. Therefore, grabbing a banana, I started a hunt for squirrels and rabbits that surrounded my temporary shelter. Throwing a banana at the unfortunate animals was a damn stupid idea, maybe you should have tried an apple? Despite the setback, it was quite fun. Time flew by quickly. It was already dark, and before spending the night I had to get through the forest with the branches set on fire, along the way collecting fly agarics, from which later, perhaps, it would be possible to synthesize something very good. :) So the first day on the island passed. Nice, atmospheric. English is simple, tutorial with pictures, diaries and notes are written quite simply. ",True,False

Also, the story is funny, it's sad, it's touching, just like the anime, or so my friends told me (I've only watched a few episodes, LOL). + Worked well with my 360 controller + Many playable characters + Like watching a summary of the anime + HACK & SLASH & SMASH & RUSH your way through the enemies + Many combos + Good length + Anime graphics + Didn't experience any crash - Repetitive gameplay It's been a while since I last played this, so if there was any other cons, I don't remember any of it now.

"This game.... it was a complete surprise to me. I only paid 6€ for a bundle with Metro: Last Light Redux and Metro 2033 Redux, and from these 2 this one is much better. The story is interesting tho you have to play the Metro 2033 Redux inorder to understand the story more. This games story is not generic zombie apocalyple but insted it tells about people in Moscows  metro tunnels trying to survive after a nuclear war, and on the surface there are mutated animals that have taken over earth. I did not have any major issues with the games performance and it was surprisingly smooth at higher settings and I was getting about 60-70 fps on average. In this game the mutated animals are not the main enemy but the humans who still want to fight against each other. There are the: Reds aka communists, Reich aka nazis, and your own ""group"". The story tells about how the Reds want to take over the metro tunnels and kill everyone else who is not a communist. All and all this is a great game and I would definetly recommend it to anyone especially if this game is on sale. Id give this game 8/10 or 9/10. ",True,False
"Well, it was time to write this review. I mean, I managed to finish the guide in French for Delta Pavonis I've begun four years ago (shame on me, I had just to finish Act 3!), I wrote a guide in English for Sol for Neoseeker that I intend to translate in French for Steam. And I finally started Academy Year 1. Anyway, you won't believe that it was a pleasure to replay the whole saga. Hop on on Sol! Gail Pilgrim, her trusted co-pilot Sabina White, friends Ashanti and Jojo, her father and his very good friend Karen Morant have been arrested on Planet Leto. They find themselves in Prison Station 13, where they meet an old friend of Emet's. Gail will be facing though choices that will have consequences on the rest of her adventures and learn truths about her own family... I won't spoil you but you bet that Gail and Sabina will not stay in jail for the whole story. Sabina will not permit it anyway. While I loved the plot of the three first games, I must say that knowing that we would have a mockery of a trial and the crew in prison made me uncomfortable, better, very very anxious about that. However, I was relieved to see that it was only during the prologue and Act One. Also, the fact that you have to make choices is welcome too, though only exploited twice. I was relieved to see that the first one is at the end of Act 1, meaning that I don't have to relieve that anxious moment of trial. Even four years after, I've still that feeling in my stomach about that part. But what made Space Pilgrim very enjoyable didn't disappear. The humour is still present and Sabina really showed another aspect of her personality. She's easily my favorite character, more than Gail, not because she's badass but because I can see some parts of myself (not really social, logical) though I lack her confidence. And then, you can see also how previous events are affecting the story.  I also love the fact that we can still mess with the intercom on Quicksilver (with Sabina reacting to it apart one time where it was Emet) or having Zubar play its part. The cat and the intercom are recurring jokes in the universe, like Galactic Hospital, a soap opera parodying our real soap opera: you don't understand a thing but it's addictive for some. The gameplay is still the same: pick objects, combine, speak, offer items, etc.. It's pretty rare to have puzzles, though it's the first time we have to enter a letter-password and not a combination. We even have a puzzle related to sound associated to numbers. However, it's still easy to finish the adventure as the clues or how to proceed are often explained. I've still have an hard time with the use item/use with because I go too fast. The game can be played with mouse and/or keyboard (the SHIFT key is useful to dash). And as usual, in Quicksilver, going to the kitchen with the mouse is still not fixed but well, that's a minor inconvenience. The graphics are still good and I loved them, but well it's RPG Maker. I also loved the soundtrack. I really love it, very fitting. Anyway, it's the perfect conclusion for the Space Pilgrim Saga. Really, I would recommend the whole series without problems! ",True,False

Pros: Cons: In general it is a good game to get out of the genre, you finish it quickly and you learn a lot from it.

"По первым анонсам The Witcher должен был выйти в 1997 году. На тот момент разработчиками являлась студия  (Польша), но как-то не пошло. Разработку в свои руки взяла   только в 2004 году, когда сама же студия появилась в 2002 году. Здесь не надо путать   с  , т.к это не одно и тоже,   — это студия разработки видеоигр, а   — это холдинговая компания, владеющая Red'ами. Ещё многие неправильно произносят название студии, говоря [Cиди проджект рэд], когда правильное польское название [цеде проэкт рэд], это для справки, заметьте Projekt, а не Project. Сама игра вышла в 2007 году, главным протагонистом оказался Геральт из Ривии, главный герой саги Анджея Сапковского. Нельзя не сказать, что игра делалась по мотивам его книг. Им, на сегодняшний день, 20 лет. История игры продолжает книжную сагу Сапковского. Геральт выживает после сюжета книг и появляется в лесу, близ Каэр Морхена, его преследуют, и Геральт, пытаясь скрыться, падает и теряет сознание. Очухивается Белый Волк уже в своем доме, в Каэр Морхене, бывшей школе ведьмаков. Сейчас   — это обычная крепость, служащая домом для нескольких ведьмаков. Геральта сюда донесли его «коллеги». В Крепости оказались сразу много знакомых лиц: Весемир, ненастоящий отец Геральта, Ламберт, Эскель, хорошист друг и ровесник Геральта, Лео, самый младший из ведьмаков, и Трисс Меригольд, чародейка и подруга Геральта. Проблема в том, что Геральт ничего не помнит, даже их имен. У него амнезия и он не помнит, что с ним приключилось до событий игры. Через какое-то время на Каэр Морхен нападает банда Саламандр, и герою приходиться защищать собственный дом. Здесь и появляется первый сюжетный твист. Сейчас вам и придется испытать здешнею боевую систему, а её я затрону позже. В ходе этих событий погибает Лео, но зато вы узнаете имена главных антагонистов игры: Азар Явед и некий Профессор, которые украли из лаборатории Каэр Морхена ведьмачьи секреты по производству ведьмаков. Процесс производства ведьмаков крайне страшный, 3 из 10 мальчиков выживали, а еще меньше проходили его вторую часть, из-за этого Каэр Морхен и прекратил свое производство. Геральт прошёл все испытания и стал ведьмаком, но не без потерь, а потерял он долю своих эмоций и природный цвет волос. После всех событий в Каэр Морхене, ведьмаки решают разделиться и найти Саламандр, Геральту выпадает Вызима, столица Темерии. В деревне под ней и начинается сюжет первого Ведьмака.  — убийцы чудовищ, частично лишенные чувств и полностью стерильны, т.е не могут иметь детей. Процесс становления обычного мальчика в ведьмака называется Испытанием Травами. Будущего ведьмака привязывают к пыточному столу и заливают в его вены специальный отвар, который мутирует клетки мальчика, превращая его в ведьмака. После недельной комы уже ведьмак, а не мальчик, начинает тренироваться и получать свой ведьмачий медальон. Существует всего 3 школы ведьмаков: грифона, кота и волка, Геральт принадлежит к школе волка. Почему только 3? В книгах упоминаются только 3 ведьмачьи школы. Есть еще теория, что школа кота является выдуманной, и в нее входят заказные убийцы, что сбежали из школы Волка, не желая быть истинными ведьмаками, но сейчас не про теории. Главное отличие ведьмака от человека — это повышенная скорость реакции и частичный иммунитет к ядам, алкоголю и смертельным эликсирам. У ведьмаков есть серебряные и стальные мечи. Стальной для людей и зверей, а серебряный для чудовищ и призраков. ""Воистину, нет ничего более отвратного, нежели монстры оные, натуре противные, ведьмаками именуемые, ибо суть они плоды мерзопакостного волшебства и диавольства. Это есть мерзавцы без достоинства, совести и чести, истинные исчадия адовы, токмо к убиениям приспособленные. Нет таким, како оне, места меж людьми почтенными.Воистину, нет ничего более отвратного, нежели монстры оные, натуре противные, ведьмаками именуемые, ибо суть они плоды мерзопакостного волшебства и диавольства. Это есть мерзавцы без достоинства, совести и чести, истинные исчадия адовы, токмо к убиениям приспособленные. Нет таким, како оне, места меж людьми почтенными."" Аноним. Монструм или ведьмака описание. Боевка… своеобразная, вам не нужно закликивать противников, вам нужно один раз ударить и дождаться нужного тайминга, чтобы ударить ещё раз, ещё раз и ещё раз, но это оригинально и связано с тем, что вы не просто мечом бьете, а фехтуете им. Всего 3 боевых стиля:  , что подходит для одного, но медлительного противника,  , который подходит для одного, но ловкого противника, и  , что подходит для любых, но не одиночных противников. Вы можете находить эликсиры или изготовлять их из конкретных для каждого эликсира ингредиентов. С бомбами ситуация такая же. Древо навыков довольно большое: есть 3 вида скилл-поинтов:  ,   и  . Есть и навыки, которые можно качать только определенным скилл-поинтом. К прокачке доступны:  , повышает шанс уворота,  , повышает ХП, и ещё много всего прочего, включая знаки и стили боёвки, но отдельно для серебряного и стального меча. В игре можно носить много оружия: Топоры, мечи и кинжалы, но можно носить, например 2 меча, 1 топор и 2 кинжала, что очень странно для ведьмака. Выглядит Геральт как Рубайла или кузнец. Системы крафта нет, но есть торговцы, которые могут вам продать снаряжение. По игре вы можете получить Броню Ворона, которая является лучшей в игре и появляется на вас в The Witcher 2, если перенести сохранения. Ещё есть 2 меча — Арондит, серебряный, и Д’иабль, стальной. Они также появляются в The Witcher 2, если перенести сохранения. В игре вам встретится куча противников, начиная от людей и заканчивая призраками и гулями. Вам придется использовать весь инвентарь ведьмака, чтобы ощутить радость после убийства кучки недругов. В игре есть и спутницы — Шани или Трисс, в зависимости от выбора можно получить отличающийся сюжет и секс-карту партнера. Кстати о секс-картах, коих здесь немало, после полового акта с уникальным партнером, вы получаете его карту. На этом всё.",True,False

"Okay, I'm gonna go straight to the point here. I love the concept that this game has. I think the fact that you can rebirth and master multiple skills instead of being restricted to one class is really cool. Being a music teacher, I also love how you can compose music on here using actual music theory. The in-game music is pretty awesome as well. One thing I don't like is how buggy the game is. The pathwaying for the game seems pretty sloppy, as I occasionally find myself glitching in the same spot when I try to talk forward (especially through the narrow hallways in the dungeons). I also invited some friends to play the game, and it seems like most of them have problems when they try to launch it (these people also have very capable computers, so I wouldn't call it a systematic problem). Another thing that really bothers me is the pop-up tip windows. I try disabling them, but it doesn't seem to work. It's tediously annoying to have to deal with that appearing in the middle of my screen during a fight.  Overall, I like this game. I think you'll enjoy it too, if you can work around the little annoying bugs and pop-up windows. ",True,False

"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Чистое Небо - вторая игра из франшизы Сталкер, от разработчиков GSC Game World. Является самостоятельным аддоном. Жанр представлен в виде шутера от первого лица, с элементами ролевой игры. Дата выхода 2008г. Чистое Небо является приквелом и рассказывает нам историю о наёмнике по кличке Шрам, который выполняя своё задание по сопровождению учёных в Зоне, попадает под мощнейший Выброс. Выжить ему удаётся благодаря необычным способностям организма, однако каждый следующий такой сверх выброс, будет постепенно убивать его. Главному герою не остаётся ничего другого, как попытаться предотвратить подобные катаклизмы в Зоне, которые по заверениям членов группировки Чистое Небо, спровоцированы группой сталкеров, намеревающихся добраться до ЧАЭС. Сюжет понравился за развитие идей первой части, раскрытие многих подробностей о первых походах Стрелка к центру Зоны, за наличие уже знакомых полюбившихся персонажей и группировок, а также за появление не менее каноничных, новых, за потрясающую концовку, плавно подводящую нас к событиям начала Теней Чернобыля. В основном сюжете появились довольно оригинальные и увлекательные задания, не завязанные на простых убийствах и поиске определенных вещей, как это было ранее. Понравился измененный баланс и внутриигровая система торговли/продажи. Увеличена ценность и сокращено количество артефактов, теперь заработать большие деньги не так и просто, а тратить их прийдется немало, как на починку и усовершенствование снаряжения, так и на покупку тайников и амуниции. Благодаря этому стало намного увлекательней исследовать уровни, в поиске ценных вещей. Одним из самых главных нововведений является война группировок. С самого начала разработчики предоставляют нам возможность ознакомиться с новой геймплейной механикой, сделав упор в начальных квестах, на сражении с противоборствующими группировками. В дальнейшем появляется возможность вступить в любую из 4 группировок (одиночки, бандиты, свобода, долг) и привести одну из них к победе, сначала захватив ключевые, стратегические позиции, а затем и уничтожив основную базу врагов. У каждой группировки есть свои уникальные торговцы, проводники и ремонтники. Выбор любой из сторон, будет давать свои определенные бонусы, такие как расширенный ассортимент и скидки у торговцев, ремонт и апгрейд разных видов оружия, которые не доступны у других, а также наличие нескольких побочных квестов. Если быть откровенным, то данное нововведение не пошло игре на пользу. Да, понравилось появление возможности вступать в различные группировки, отыгрывать определенную роль в них, того же ""братка по понятиям"" или ""идеологичного долговца"", однако не хватает наличия уникальных заданий. Все квесты связанные с войной группировок по захвату и защите лагерей идентичны. Более того, вступив в какую либо из группировок, у вас появляются обязанности по защите своих соклановцев, которые то и дело будут постоянно просить о помощи. Многие задания повторяются. Захватив определенную точку, её часто приходиться отвоёвывать снова. Иногда появляются несколько заданий, сделать, которые одновременно, не представляется возможным. Мир игры получился чрезвычайно перенаселён сталкерами, лагеря которых, теперь расположены каждые 20 метров. Данное нововведения полностью убивает весь романтизм сталкерства, превращая игру в классический шутер, так как заставляет бегать от одной точки к другой и убивать сотни сталкеров. Абсолютно все нпс как враги так и дружественные, отображены соответствующими метками на карте. К тому же отображены даже передвижения мутантов. Да, это сделано для удобства в сражениях с группировками, однако выглядит нелепо, не логично, да и полностью разрушает атмосферу непредсказуемости путешествий по Зоне. Очень понравилось нововведение связанное с поиском артефактов. Если в первой части они просто валялись на земле в разных местах, и для их добычи не требовалось каких-либо дополнительных действий, то теперь, чтобы найти артефакт, необходимо иметь специальный прибор в виде детектора. Помимо этого, артефакты обычно находятся в больших скоплениях аномалий, что ещё больше усложняет процесс их добычи. Также в лучшую сторону был произведен ребаланс характеристик всех артефактов. Каждый из них имеет одно положительное свойство, однако все они радиоактивны. В дополнении к пулестойкости, улучшения выносливости, защиты от химических и физических воздействий, появились столь нужные артефакты пси защиты и артефакты увеличивающие грузоподъемность персонажа. Ещё одной достаточно важной, новой геймплейной особенностью стал ремонт, прокачка оружия и брони. Всё ваше снаряжение можно отремонтировать у техников за определенную плату. Есть несколько веток модернизации экипировки и оружия. Прокачать максимально можно лишь одну, либо частично обе, тут зависит от ваших целей. Броню можно улучшить либо в сторону защиты от химических и радиоактивных излучений, либо в сторону пулестойкости, плюс несколько дополнительных свойств для разных костюмов, таких как увеличение слотов для артефактов, увеличения переносимого веса или встроенный ПНВ. Что же касается оружия, то тут выбор стоит между улучшением точности и скорострельности, в связке с ними, можно повысить износостойкость, уменьшить отдачу, увеличить магазин, поставить крепления для подствольников и прицелов или даже изменить калибр оружия под другой патрон. Данное нововведение вносит определенное разнообразие, позволяет значительно улучшить оружие по нескольким показателям. В игру было добавлено несколько новых, больших и качественно проработанных локаций. Кроме того, часть старых уровней времен ТЧ, были значительно доработы, увеличилась их детализация, а по границам уровней были сделаны новые проходы. Они по прежнему частично были созданы по образу реального существующих заброшенных мест Чернобыльской Зоны Отчуждения и создают невероятно сильную атмосферу советского пост апокалипсиса. Пожалуй именно эта часть из серии имеет лучшую графику и является технически самой продвитуй. Помимо перехода на Directx 10, движок обзавелся улучшенной системой динамического освещения. Была изменена цветопередача, ставшая более яркой и насыщенной. Появился эффект фокусировки на оружии при перезарядке. Добавлены новые модели окружения и персонажей более высокого качества, последние ещё и обзавелись новыми анимациями стрельбы из-за укрытий, исследования аномальных местностей с детектором и парой других движений. Однако вслед за званием самого технологичного продукта GSC, ЧН получило звание и самой забагованной игры. Трудно представить в каком состоянии была игра на момент выхода, если даже спустя столько лет, официальная версия по-прежнему имеет огромное количество техническим проблем. Плохая оптимизация при определенных настройках понижает фпс до не комфортных значений, даже на самых мощных платформах. Ошибки в скриптах и фризы уже стали неотъемлемой частью движка X-Ray. Периодически наблюдались даже проблемы с отображением картинки. Игра неприлично часто вылетает. Причём вылет можно словить абсолютно в любой ситуации, что говорит, о наличии большого количества ошибок. Встречаются частые проблемы с проработкой путей для НПС, которые то и дело врезаются друг в друга, застревая на месте, не умеют обходить игрока и таранят его. У многих моделей оружия сбита прицельная мушка, что напрочь портит впечатление от геймплея при перестрелках, не говоря уже о других более мелких недоработках.",True,False

"So, I got to the end of the storyline and completed all the side quests (except one). And I really want to share my humble opinion. I want to note right away that the game dragged me in very much, which is very unusual for the SURVIVAL genre. But one feature really makes this game stand out from its colleagues in the genre. THERE IS A FULL Plot. And ... he's not bad. There are attempts at drama, a semblance of intrigue, and even an UNEXPECTED TURN. I would also like to note the secondary tasks. Many people complain that it is just ""give, bring, kill"". And yes, there are such tasks, but they are needed in order to pump the respect of different NPCs, but it does not give anything special. New recipes, currency, experience, well, standard, in short. And here it is STORY side quests. This is just my compliments. They are unique and have a great story, which I didn't expect. But this is really cool. And they are very impressive. But the main plot in the end began to enrage you with the fact that you were forced to run half the map, and then back. There is a semblance of front travel points here, but there are few of them and they are usually not fucking along the way. But the ending is cool, albeit stupid. Optimization? Well, on my laptop it seemed like the norms worked, except for friezes during an autosave. On the forum I saw the same problem with a person, but I could not find a solution. Bugs? Yes. There are a lot of them, animation bugs during battles. Sometimes you can just get stuck (for such cases there is a button in the menu so that you will be spawned at the beginning of the map without losing your inventory. And a suicide button))) I also got a bug in the last mission, but thank God it worked after several reboots. Well, my comments. I was pissed off by the illogical arrangement of some of the plot items. Here are 3 notes for you. 2 on the table, and the third, damn it, somewhere in the ass. Therefore, several times I googled where this shit lies. Fucking girl screamer in random places. I almost threw the keyboard into the monitor. In general, the game in places is very impressive with its atmosphere of horror and despair. Straight cool. It's also cool that as you search for colectables, the room in the hub also develops. There is a co-op, but I haven't played it. And also coolly implemented some of the survival features that piss off in other games of this genre, so it is interesting to survive and loot here, not boring. I caught myself thinking that I was looting to cook different dishes, and not to pump weapons. So definitely I ADVISE, for full price niche so. FOR SALE TAKE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ",True,False

"Правильнее всего было бы обрамить рецензию на Human Revolution кучей всяких вставок с дополнительными материалами, в которых бы я со знанием дела рассуждал бы о киберпанке, о тематических отсылках, о тонне «пасхалок». А весь обзор был бы пропитан восторженным духом — дескать, крутейшая RPG появилась на прилавках, надо брать и все такое. Только незачем все это. Посвящать материалы великим играм, которые появляются раз в несколько лет, всегда очень и очень тяжело. И не потому, что слова куда-то пропадают, а от благоговения руки дрожат, как у стоматолога на первом приеме. Все несколько проще. Deus Ex сейчас на слуху у всех. Ее проходят, детально изучают, соревнуясь, кто быстрее «подсветит» все «ачивменты». А после открывают для себя заново в поисках иных путей и решений. И обсуждают. Помногу обсуждают… В данном случае мой вид рецензии «текст да и тоьлко» — лишь подтверждение общего мнения, не более того. Поэтому центральное место на данной страничке хочется посвятить пояснению того, почему Human Revolution стоит пройти хотя бы раз.                                                         Мы так привыкли к простым и зрелищным играм. Почти всегда относимся к ним с иронией, приговаривая: «Ну пустое и простое развлекалово со спецэффектами — зато весело!» Все реже шутеры вместе с ролевыми, простите, эпосами и всякими там инди-стратегиями заставляют нас думать, изучать, проводить параллели с событиями реального мира. Во главе геймплея принято сейчас ставить зрелищность вкупе с доступностью. Это когда вроде и красиво все выглядит, но участия от зрителя требует минимального. Human Revolution уникальна тем, что она на многие наработки и законы индустрии, сформировавшиеся за последние лет семь, плюет с усыпанного неоновыми растяжками небоскреба ночного города. Если отнестись к феномену третьей Deus Ex со здравой долей скептицизма, то можно предположить, что разработчики сделали историю Адама именно такой только потому, что слепо следовали канонам серии, потенциал которой так же безграничен, как и сам киберпанк. Отчасти это так. Но нужно понимать: на руках у Eidos Montreal были лишь общие правила придуманной некогда Уорреном Спектором концепции. Все остальное — это личное желание команды показать играющему миру, что с пути развития индустрии можно и нужно свернуть. Суть геймплея Human Revolution легко описать сухими, испепеляющими своей убедительностью фактами, и в конкретном случае это будет ей на руку. Как приятно говорить о таких важных вещах, как нелинейность каждого уровня, масса вариантов развития событий на отдельном участке миссии, бесконечное комбинирование стелса с «шумным поведением», и понимать, что здесь все это действительно работает на должном уровне. Умение вести диалог с персонажем самым прямым образом сказывается на дальнейших событиях. И если вы кого-то подставили, то не забывайте, что спустя несколько часов обиженный простофиля в порыве ярости приставит к вашей голове дуло пистолета. А спасенный террорист предложит посильную помощь. Та самая двухзвенная цепочка «выбор-последствие», которой без лишней скромности гордились девелоперы, практически всегда показывает свою состоятельность. Да, это работает. В Deus Ex: Human Revolution практически все работает. Сюжет увлекает с первых минут — события развиваются по принципу снежного кома, и уже ближе к середине игры вы будете с поразительной внимательностью и нехарактерной для вас чуткостью просматривать очередной ролик. Помимо центральной истории, есть ведь еще убедительная кипа дополнительных. Ни одну из них — действительно ни одну! — язык не поворачивается назвать сайд-квестом. Дополнительное задание здесь — полная интриг и неожиданных поворотов детективная история с характерно неочевидным концом. Неважно, что придется делать — помогать ли измученной матери узнать правду о гибели дочери, подстраивать смерть влиятельного плохиша-китайца так, чтобы сошло за несчастный случай…                                                 Возможность выбора подходящего вашему темпераменту стиля прохождения предполагает гибкую систему прокачки. Сразу отметим, что все те красивые вещи, которые вытворял Адам Дженсен в трейлерах, вы сможете опробовать в полной мере. Невидимость, расчетливый ближний бой, безболезненное приземление с любой высоты, ультразащита и сверхскорость, способность видеть сквозь стены и ломать их — пробуйте, экспериментируйте. При особой сноровке, желании изучить каждый закоулок и помочь всем на свете ближе к середине игры из главного героя получится сделать настоящего «универсала». Ведь опыт начисляют почти за любое контекстное действие. Начиная от поиска потаенных местечек и заканчивая уговорами особо упертых интеллектуалов. Вот тогда терпеливые почемучки смогут убедиться воочию, что кампанию можно пройти не только всадив каждой твари по пуле, но и бережно убаюкав транквилизаторами глупых ротозеев. А можно и то и другое. Или даже третье — проползти по душной «кишке» вентиляции, взломать дверной замок квартиры какого-нибудь крайне важного субъекта, спереть у него карманный компьютер с паролями и добраться до нужного места с наименьшими затратами. Конечно, максимально Human Revolution раскрывается при «скрытном» прохождении. Ведь прятаться по темным углам, шнырять по крышам и вражеским офисам в режиме маскировки, вырубать всех исподтишка, складировать тела в неприметных кабинетах — всего этого негласно требует атмосфера. Но и как шутер Deus Ex тоже вполне хороша. Масса видов оружия (то, что отдельных экземпляров в каждой категории по одной штуке, не важно), слаженная работа ИИ (особенно на высокой сложности), красивое обращение героя с укрытиями и приятные на слух звуки выстрелов способны в одночасье превратить стелс-экшен в самодостаточный боевик. А толковая архитектура уровней позволяет комбинировать оба режима, водя охранников за нос поначалу и жестоко расправляясь с ними разрядом дроби в лицо после долгих пряток среди столов, ящиков, автоматов с колой и прочей мебели. В перерывах между боевыми действиями различного устройства и стиля случаются шикарнейшие диалоги. То, что с собеседником можно напортачить и невольно заставить его замолчать — правда. Советуем вам с самого начала улучшить чип, отвечающий за личностный анализ и подбор правильного русла для общения. Так узнавать тайны будет веселее, а убеждать — проще. Разговорам вообще уделено много внимания. Даже тем, в которых вы непосредственно можете и не участвовать. Не стесняйтесь подслушивать болтовню обывателей — так они с вами ценными сведениями поделятся (где, что, у кого и как можно украсть), да и просто свежие сплетни на уши намотают. Общение с ключевыми же персонажами поначалу спихивают в ролики, но, опять же, ближе к середине все чаще у Дженсена будут случаться настоящие словесные дуэли. Именно в такие моменты аналитическое мышление и умение в нужный момент надавить на собеседника, зная его особенности, сослужат вам хорошую службу, принеся неповторимое удовольствие от положительного результата. А стараться ведь есть во имя чего — то самое нападение на офис компании Sarif Industries грозится стать началом череды событий, описание которых благополучно следует опустить по «антиспойлерным» причинам. Ждавших красивой киберпанк-истории, но ранее не искушавших себя изучением подобных произведений ждет наиприятнейший сюрприз. Ну а игроки, видавшие первые две Deus Ex и пересмотревшие историю любви Декарта к «Нексус-6», будут слегка разочарованы. Ибо ничего принципиально нового они, как поклонники жанра, для себя не откроют — лишь восхитятся работой сценаристов над жонглированием давно принятыми в соответствующей культурной среде истинами. Deus Ex: Human Revolution крайне нетипична для ролевой игры образца 2011-го года. Она слишком комплексная, стильная, требующая к себе много внимания, не обделенная красивой историей с интересными дополнительными заданиями и великолепными диалогами, очень умная и достаточно долгая. Работающий сплав сразу из нескольких жанров, прекрасная сказка (сказка ли?) о ценности первозданной человеческой сущности",True,False

"As me being not a fan of single player games I decided to pick this game up with a friend. So this review is mostly directed to those who also haven't played the original game. The Art style and the humor of the game are great. I love every little detail about it. The dark setting and humor really make the game quite enjoyable. Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with. As for the multiplayer  performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash. It is already a very solid product. When I read the word Beta I was set to experience some bugs and crashes. But none until now.  If you haven't played the game. Go and play it. Update: Haven't played this game for a while and picked it up again recently. I really am enjoying the fact that they added even more content and refined the existing features. Really pumped to give the ""A New Reign: Part 2"" Update a try tonight. ",True,False

"My first ever entry to this series. I can definitely say that it holds up better than Skyrim. I like that in Morrowind there is that deep rooted RPG element that you can really play and choose your character the way you want to. This game has polearms, throwing daggers, knifes and crossbows, something that got scraped into later titles and for shame. The game is harder since its not your typical defeat your enemy in one-two hits. A lot of the times hitting someone or something will miss and you really need to focus your skill points in the right place. Spells and mage builds really are powerful here, with having to deal with draining different attributes can make you stop in your tracks quite often. Don't attack and go after just anyone and mages especially. The journal tracking can be confusing because it writes like a journal and not like standard objectives. The map is mostly ash and swamps, your usual wasteland with lots of dungeons, which I personally like to explore a lot, since they are straightforward and short.  In spite of it being an older title I would recommend to everyone wanting to experience that old school journey before everything was toned down for casual play. ",True,False

"The game itself improved quite a lot since its launch. It improved from a Sean Murray's dream projection game design, to a complete space exploration sandbox multiplayer game, that now even has VR support. I was dubious at first. The game would have died in the launch. But kinda like Sea of Thieves, it has got content updates ever since, patched with hundreds of hotfixes and now for me, it's now one of the, IF NOT THE BEST space exploration game around right now. The community is helpful, the Steam Workshop is full of creative buildings to have and the game rewards you a feeling of pure relaxation if you're just into discovering. Of course, there's space combat PvE for those who like the adrenaline too. Overall, I'd give the game a solid 8 out of 10. There a few more things that need to be polished. The movement is a bit droopy. Not that I care much. Thanks for making the future of space exploration Hello Games! ",True,False
"The game was very short and pretty easy, and coming from someone who generally struggles with puzzle/platforming games that probably means something.   However, I'm not convinced that's why someone would play this game.  Its dreamy soundscape, sweet/thoughtful narration and a simple yet beautiful artistic direction kept me interested in the handful of hours I got out of the game.  I actually found myself caring for this ragtag band of four-sided shapes, with all of their different personalities and flaws.  The best comparison I feel I can make is kind of like an interactive childrens book.  It's not overly complicated, it may not amaze you... but there can be beauty in simplicity and it can be appreciated all the same. Might not be worth full price to a seasoned gamer who expects more than three hours of gameplay and easy-ish puzzles, but if you can find it on sale, it may be worth the price of admission just to look at, listen to and think about.

"A very useful cooperative jester. Never played Gears and this was the first part of the series. The biggest plus is in co-op, playing such games with a friend is the very thing, especially when you get tired of online chickens. The game is divided into acts, each act (well, almost) has its own pseudo-open location, where you can find several side quests in addition to the main storyline, for the completion of which they give different upgrades for your robot companion or a unique weapon. A small flying cute robot, on the other hand, performs an auxiliary task, namely: to neutralize or reward the enemy with the help of various priblud types of a shocker, helps your team with invisibility / power-ups, takes out hard-to-reach objects / weapons, and also presses different buttons to open doors and passages. The coolest thing is that the third member of your party can play for him and do all of the above himself (well, or not and giggle at the teammates). The direct task of the player is to fuck with the Roy (the name of all local demons), whose army has both ordinary opponents (cannon fodder) and mini-bosses with different features. There are a couple of special bosses to sweat with. Of the cooperative components, there is only opening doors as in the Resident, planting and simultaneously pressing buttons and that's it, for the rest of the time you shoot at the devil or ride the Yalik. A yalik is a local vehicle, which is quite fun to ride due to pleasant control and cut across locations. The graphics in the game are decent, while the optimization allows you to play stable 60+ frames, which is good news. The design of the locations is pleasing to the eye, both winter landscapes and deserted ones. In the story missions there are separate large atmospheric locations (various kinds of underground complexes) that immerse you in the game with your head. The plot here cannot be said that the original, completely default action movie, and, in fact, it is enough that there is, it was not worth it to be wise, especially since this is a continuation of the previous parts. If you, like me, have not played other parts, then the plot can be mastered, there are no difficulties with this. Separately, we can say about the price of the game, 1000 rubles at the start is more than adequate and pleasant price, and at a discount of 550 rubles it is definitely worth taking and going with a friend.

"After my 14 hours of playing, I have finally gotten what I need to write this review. Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best games to come from Obsidian and Bethesda, and is probably my favourite Fallout game to date. I have played the 3 original Fallout's when I was younger but this game I never got to play, probably because I wasn't allowed to. But now that I have played the game, and gotten my test of it, I can  honestly say that it is an amazing game. Here's why in 5 ways. 1. The story. This game's plot is up-front and gritty. Summing it up is ""WHERE IS THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THAT SHOT ME"" instead of ""find this random thing"" or ""play chess with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ super computer"" The plot-lines are interesting and leave you wanting more at the end. There are some plot points so far that are confusing, but I won't mention that :) 2. The combat. Fallout New Vegas's combat system compared to Fallout 4's is easy. FO:NV'S makes FO4'S look like someone smashed their head on their keyboard while creating the logs, and just said ""♥♥♥♥ it, that'll do."" FO:NV's combat is fluent and never repetitive, as every gunfight is different with any enemy. Also V.A.T.S. pauses instead of slo-mo. So that's cool. 3. The saving. This may be a small feature that goes unnoticed by many, but the saving system in FO:NV is great. I myself had absolutely ♥♥♥♥ experiences with Fallout 4, where my progress wouldn't save on travel, and I would end up having to start back from my last manual save point. And the absolute worst was recently, when I lost all my save data on my lvl 65 account with everything completed. EVERYTHING! All the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grinding, the boss fights, the creations, all gone. just *poof*. After that I immediatley deleted the game and broke the disc over my knee. Luckily this doesn't happen with New Vegas. 4. The NPC'S Another thing I love about this game is the amount of fun you can have by pissing off NPC's. I can just put stuff in their face, and they go ""hey!"", then I run. But the NPC'S are very responsive in this, and kicks ass compared to FO4'S npc's like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Preston Garvey. ♥♥♥♥ you Preston. 5. The world Final point, the Mojave Wasteland is truly amazing. It never runs out of suprises (If you chose the wild wasteland perk like me, you know what I'm talking about) and it doesn't just regurgitate the same enemies and locations like FO4. It has new things at every turn, and THAT is what I like in a video game. In my conclusion, go buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. now. I'll be watching you.. crumbly :3 also caesar sucks ass ",True,False

"You certainly won't be taking any risks playing   especially considering it’s free.   This visual novel is a cute, light hearted and short experience and despite the high school setting being one that’s used a lot, the overall plot is a little more unique.   It features beautiful art, adventures and of course, adorable love stories! It’s realistic in the way that college students get pretty stressed during their exams and want to find a fun outlet. That outlet is usually partying but, in this case, it’s trespassing on old, abandoned buildings! I can’t say I’d recommend doing that but whatever floats your boat.  The MC, Alex is seen as being very human; she’s lonely and craves more (well, any type of) social interaction and when she finds it, she’s happier. She’s aware of her feelings but doesn’t always know how to act on them. She’s nervous, excitable and fearful. I found her enjoyable to play as. She was a nice contrast to a lot of the bland mc’s out there.   The LI’s also have their own realistic struggles that make them feel more alive and relatable without taking it to the extreme.   I don’t think I need to say more! ;p ",True,False

"Excellent! Finally an alien game worthy of the name! Alien, a series of cult films that we no longer present, even if some are questionable they are all very good films for me. This game takes place 14 years after the events of the first film, we play Amanda the daughter of Ripley who decides to go in search of her mother and obviously like in the movies: it turns out badly! Well what is good is that Amanda is not a new character since she is a copy-paste beast of her mother, obviously they were lazy to invent a full-fledged character ... is not serious, it's just a detail and then for me the story and the characters are secondary in a game ... We could compare this game to Outlast since we find there the principle of hollowing out enemies while hiding , being discreet, ect ... But in Alien Isolation we have so many more mechanics that the comparison quickly becomes ridiculous. We already have a rather well thought out crafting system despite a fairly heavy menu that will often put us in the wheel since the game does not pause in the inventory ... hey yes that's hot, but it This is what makes the immersion even more unique and intense. This system allows us to manufacture something to heal ourselves, smoke bombs, mines and we can sometimes find weapons like a taser, a revolver, a flame thrower but nothing that will allow the alien to be permanently killed, which is why we will need always remain discreet when you are in the same area as him. We can very rarely breathe in this game, always ""enemies"" to avoid or someone looking for us. Yes I forgot to specify but the alien is not the only threat, sometimes the androids are against us and some humans too, yeah it hurts a lot of people ... All these elements serve the immersion, coupled with a very effective gameplay that makes it an excellent horror game especially as the general atmosphere of the game is rather stressful, special mention in the last hours of play that I found really scary because the alien is more present and more lively than the rest of the game. The music is also perfectly in tune with the game to set the mood and look a lot like those in the film, which is far from being a defect ... Technically the game is rather clean, well optimized so nothing to say about it I think we could hardly do better. In short, magnificent! ",True,False

"the game is fun, the soundtrack and the graphics are great, you can play a lot of characters from the one piece universe and there are a lot of moves and combos you can do. the only thing I don't like about this game is the way it tells the story. sometimes characters appear out of nowhere without any information given about them. when you play a chapter the character you use is fighting with everyone and the other crew members are useless. (when I played Alabasta I used Luffy and I defeated Mr 1, Mr 2, Mr 3 and Crocodile without any help) in conclusion, it's a must have if you're familiar with the one piece series. if not, don't buy it.

"Well, here I got the last achievement, and probably it's time to write a review of the game. I first got acquainted with the Final Fantasy series from this part, and then on the advice of a best of the best friend. Therefore, I will write a review like someone who has never played the previous Final Fantasy games. Also, I will not compare it with other parts, because I simply cannot do it. Well, let's start point by point: 1. Battle system. We have an ATB scale made up of segments. Having filled the scale with actions, we choose a target, and our character begins to perform them. Each action takes away some part of the scale, at the initial stages of the game 1 action is 1-2 segments, but at later stages, there are abilities that occupy a maximum of segments, and theirs, for a second, as many as 6. Having done what we are "" ordered "", the character enters a"" neutral state ""and our scale begins to recharge. Only after the scale is again filled with segments, we can choose a sequence of actions for our hero. In battle we control only one member of the group, the other two are controlled by AI. 2) RPG component. There are so-called paradigms in the game. They are our tactical center, where we have to (!!!) before the fight choose roles and create a model of behavior for our ""dreamteam"". Initially one character, strong in three roles, but towards the end of the game, all roles are revealed to each character in order to be versatile and functional. To make the roles more effective, you need to open them (late stage of the game) and pump them in Cristrarium for CP (Cristrarium points). CP can only be obtained in one way, and that is to win in battles. After the end of the battle, in addition to CP, you will be given with some chance an item that is used mainly for pumping weapons and accessories, but you can also be given the accessory itself. It all depends on the type of your enemy. 3) An abundance of weapons and accessories to personalize our team. By the end of the game, each hero has 8 tools that you need to find (!!!) and with which you can kill your unfortunate enemies. Each weapon has a different set of characteristics and some ""farts"" have passive abilities that affect the effectiveness of the battle. And naturally, each weapon can be pumped using the components that we get, either by killing someone, or by finding a ""treasure ball"". Each weapon has 3 stages of its ""apogee"". This is when the weapon reaches its maximum level in one stage, and in order to move on to the next stage, you need a catalyst that can be obtained in the way described above. Back to the ""treasure balls"" and here's my advice: DO NOT MISS THEM EVER. Everything that is in them, everything will be useful to you, even if it is an accessory that you already have, or a component. Oh yes, there are 4 types of components: Organic, synthetic, premium and catalysts. In order to effectively pump equipment, you must first use organic components, since they give an experience multiplier (maximum x3 or + 200%), and then use synthetic ones, the so-called base. It is better to sell premium components immediately and buy something with the proceeds. And I have already told about catalysts. They are used to move weapons from one stage to another. 4) Soundtrack. Everything is perfect at this point. The voices are incredible for the characters. I read about how the cast was selected and how they trained their voices and how they voiced. I have no words. Many thanks to the developers for such work and diligence in the selection of actors and work with voices. About music .... Hmm. It is illogical only in places. There are literally a couple of moments where it does not fit the events taking place on your screen at all. But most of the music is very, very epic. 5) The plot. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the game's plot. He's great. You yourself must feel it. Feel each character. Characters, relationships, all-all aspects. And when you get to the end of the game, your jaw will drop from what is happening on the screen. You yourself should see how the characters will change before your eyes, for good or bad. At this point I will probably end and give the game a rating of 9.5 eidolons and 10. Oh, yes, about eidolons, they can be called for help in battles. According to the plot, they first appear in moments of ""psychological instability"" of the characters to ""help"" us. Thanks for reading this review. Good luck =) If you have any questions about the game, then add and ask, I will be happy to answer. ",True,False

"For players who are well acquainted with ETS2 and have wound hundreds of thousands of virtual kilometers, ATS will not be a revelation. You will not see anything fundamentally new here. Exactly the same gameplay, absolutely the same graphics, the same positive aspects and the same jambs. The difference is felt only in the picturesque American views outside the window of your truck, in the American traffic rules, and in the rather challenging trailer parking. Yes, parking now really challenges the player, but, however, nothing particularly difficult for experienced gurus who came here from Europe) I liked the cities that are more meticulously worked out than in ETS2. The trip from one end of the city to the other now takes time, and does not fly by in a few seconds. The cities are quite beautiful, the elaboration of locations is much higher than in ETS2, there are lively places, incl. and there are more pedestrians on the sidewalks and in the eateries. The cities are not made as a carbon copy, but are designed in accordance with real prototypes - you will not confuse Las Vegas with anything! Another innovation is the cops. If in Europe it was possible to drive, exceeding all conceivable and inconceivable limits, having previously roughly remembered the location of the cameras, or simply focusing on signs and slowing down in certain places, then this style of driving does not work. There are not many cops, but a lot. Sometimes there are two police cars in the frame. If you exceed it in full view of the cop, get ready to fork out for a fabulous fine. The trucks here are different, not ""flat-faced"" Europeans, but typical ""Americans"" - with a long front dimension, which at first may seem inconvenient from habit, but you get used to it quickly. The only BUT is that there are very few trucks. This is ridiculous compared to the variety of brands and models in ETS2. However, it is important that the motherboard Steam is screwed into the game, in which there are quite high-quality (I would say, not inferior in quality to the originals) models of trucks of different brands. Territory is very small, again compared to ETS2. It also doesn't feel the state boundaries in the same way as the country boundaries in ETS. There, buildings and signs and the type of traffic cars changed, but here, in fact, only the designation of the speed limit on the cruise control changes ... After the first ten hours of gameplay, the roads become boring - which I did not notice in ETS. The monotony starts to get boring, while quite quickly, unlike its predecessor. As for the complaints of the reviewers about the discrepancy between the readings of the devices and the real ones, or about the traffic behavior - I, having wound many tens of hours of real time in both games, did not encounter these problems. And in general. The speedometer shows the same number as on the route advisor. The fuel indicator also shows an identical value. Dangerous traffic rebuilding, undercutting or something else like that - I have not encountered during the entire period of my playing career. On the contrary, the traffic is even being overly polite. It is enough just to drive carefully and observe the signs and traffic lights. Inconsistency of instrument readings can be caused by mods or settings. For example, in European cars the speedometer is marked in km / h, in American cars - in miles / h. And if you set km / h in the game settings, then mechanical devices in American cars will still be miles away. Hence the difference in readings. Also, cop mods can affect traffic behavior, judging by the mod comments. Therefore, gentlemen, before you find fault - try to play a ""clean"" unmodified game, turn on your head, and only then draw conclusions. To summarize, I can say that ATS is a good game, but with an inadequate price tag. Its price without discount is slightly less than blockbusters, and in fact this game is only a large-scale DLC for ETS2. Objectively, ATS falls short of blockbuster and clearly falls short of its price tag. If you liked ETS2, then you can't miss ATS. But I would wait for an acceptable discount. Still, the game is still cut and cut .. I would very much like to hope that the expansion of the vehicle fleet promised by the developers and the addition of states will not be long in coming. If you are not familiar with this series of games and would like to try a solid truck driver simulator, take ETS2. It is both cheaper and better (at least for now, July 2016) than ATS. ",True,False
"Two qualms I have about this expansion.  1) Matt, SERIOUSLY you need a key rebind option in game. It can't be that hard. And I still cannot get this game to play on my Mac because of it. Have to boot up an old dying PC. It's borderline negligent not to include.  2) Versus mode really lacks the ability that Smash Bros has to do a mode where players have multiple lives PER stage, like they do in quest mode. It would really help mix up the action if every single mode wasn't just one life/death only per play.  Would be nice if the new stages had more waves of enemies and the 4 player quest mode was back expanded into the original, but those are perhaps excusable omissions (but still, hint hint Matt).  Other than that, it's MORE F-ING Towerfall. Which is AWESOME. This game has flawless control, fantastic music and some of the best local 4 player the video gaming world has ever seen. And contrary to some naysayers, I actually enjoy quest mode a lot. The addition of more bosses in this expansion is HELLA welcome as the original showed the potential of large screen occupying bosses but literally only had one of them. It's like Mario Kart and their continued failure to have more than 4-6 battle stages per game, it's just freaking lazy.  Love this expansion and hope there'll be more in the future. ",True,False

(new ones will be added per update) houses on one, which you can now furnish according to your own wishes and resell to customers who support you with advice and wishes.

"An amazing game, and although quite old, it started and played without any problems (not like the second Delta Force with always disappearing and flickering textures). Some missions are quite difficult, and you had to replay them several times (considering that the GG dies from a couple of hits). There is no plot in the game as such, because the whole game consists of missions that can be performed in any order (sometimes 2-3 missions to choose from are immediately available). The game has a rather modest arsenal: an MP5 submachine gun with a silencer (from which there is almost no sense, since most battles take place at medium and long distances), and you can storm the building (as well as go through most missions) with the M4, to By the way, it is equipped with an under-barrel grenade launcher (and you can easily destroy radar, missiles, cars, helicopters, and RPGs at all from the under-barrel grenade launcher), two sniper rifles M40A1 and Barret (although they are also not very useful, they are really useful only in two or three missions), two pistols, there are also in the game: grenades, anti-personnel mines (I never used them), an explosive charge (I’m ashamed to admit it, but I still don’t understand how to detonate it ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯), and double ammo (most needed). Also, the M4 can change the single / short burst mode of fire, but the truth is I also did not understand how to do this. And night missions use a night vision device. What I liked about the game was the use of the surrounding landscape as a cover. You can't just sit in one place and shoot everyone. Of course, the AI ​​of enemies does not shine with intelligence, but this does not prevent them from aiming fire at you, although at the beginning they just shoot, and only after a minute or two (if you don't run away anywhere), they will start shooting at you. Also, enemy NPCs often move, and they will definitely try to go from the flank and, or from the rear. In one of the first night missions, I got a little carried away by shooting searchlights, and missed this moment, as a result, I was surrounded from almost all sides, I had to go down below in order to get around them, climb higher up the mountain, and shoot them. By the way, the game starts in a window stretched to full screen, but there is a fix for this in the guides (though it didn't help me), but the incentive has a Borderlass Gaming program, which helped me solve the problem with the window. The game also has a resolution of 1024x768, although it can only be done through editing the config. I liked the game. And if you decide to buy, then it's better to take it right away, especially during discounts, it costs an average of 300 rubles, which is not so expensive for 15 games (though there are just over half that are suitable and playable), namely: Commanche 4, Delta Force 1 & 2, Delta Force: Land Warrior & Delta Force: Task Force Dagger, Delta Force: Xtreme 1 & 2, Delta Force: Black Hawk Down & Team Saber, Joint Operations: Combined Arms Gold & Armored Fist 3.

We are to raid, pick up drugs and run away ... but the equipment works and it would be a sin not to boil a few more kilos of crystal, even under the fire of SWAT units. When we have a few bags with goods, we run to our van - but this is not the end. On the second day, we go with the amphora to the black district to pay with it for information about the whereabouts of the bosses of a rival gang, and more specifically their entire earned money, which they are just trying to take out of the country. The deal obviously doesn't go as it should, and the shooting begins, first with the local gang and then with the cops. If we manage to escape, we go to day three, where on the access highway to the airport, we must first get the bus with our delinquents, and then stop the police long enough to transfer all the money to the helicopter sent by our employer. For each ""day"" we complete, we get a lot of money, but the real reward awaits at the end of the whole three-stage scenario. And it's one of those early on for low-level gangsters just starting their ""hopping"".

"""Pathfinder: Kingmaker"" was another game that didn't launch very well. But as time passed The development team has kept updating the game of the game until finally It has also turned out to be one of the best CRPGs you can find in the market as I am writing this review. The game has just recently been updated with a turn-based system, making the game even more attractive to anyone who doesn't like the game's original real-time combat system so much, just seeing the name Pathfinder. As you can probably say, the game was created using the rules of the TRPG of the same name, and Kingmaker is also one of the longest running campaigns. Which the development team put forward the campaign to turn it into a game that we are currently seeing. The overall content is similar in that we will play the role of an adventurer who must explore the land called The Stolen Lands. It is a wild land full of dangers. But if you're able to survive your first adventure You will become the ruler of the land and have a share in building your empire. Is like I just said The game itself has taken the rules from Pathfinder, a TRPG with almost every word, every syllable. So, if you've never experienced TRPG before, the game's complicated rules might just leave you confused and baffled. (Overall, Pathfinder is also much easier to access than DnD. If you are familiar with DnD rules, you will be able to access the rules of the game in no time). You need to stop reading every word for that. Will understand the rules and enjoy it. So if you are a gamer who has low patience and doesn't love to read much. I recommend you to avoid it. But if you're a gamer who loves to read and loves CRPG games a lot, Pathfinder: Kingmaker is definitely a game you should definitely try once. (You can check out the TRPG campaign first, the main content is quite similar.) The early content of the game might be a bit sluggish, but the game itself has quite a few interesting turning points when you can find it. Will pass the first period The game itself is said to be long and it will take you over a hundred hours to finish it.Overall, Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a game that all CRPG fans will have to try. With a price that is not too strong It is one of the quality games that is worth every penny. ",True,False

"A huge fat plus At the beginning the game shows us its excellent character editor and this is undoubtedly a plus of this game. I'm not a fan of sitting in the character editor for 10 hours, but I myself spent half an hour to create an eye-pleasing character. Of course, my gray-haired grandmother can never compare with the characters of other players: let's get to the gameplay, right? Well then, you yourself asked for it .. Gameplay As soon as you leave the editor, you immediately meet your son Sean and your husband. ... An elderly pawuk comes to us and we answer him [SARKAZM]. And we are shown the backbone of the game itself (we distribute the ""skills"" into the main talents. Later, answers will follow from these talents.

For example: They do not want to let the poorest pawuk into the shelter pancake: c Scientists with refrigerators C: meet us in the shelter, but unfortunately there will be no food in quiet refrigerators, but in these refrigerators they will freeze you together with your husband and son.

"Devil May Cry 5 - when the fan is not always right. Legendary slasher from the Japanese company Capcom. released on March 8, 2019. Due to the failure of DmC: Devil May Cry, all advertising was turned towards returning to the origins of the series and this is bad (I'll write down why below) In general, we have 3 heroes to choose from. Everyone is familiar with Dante with his famous Devil Triggers. Nero, unfortunately, without an arm, but with implants for the place of it, hurt. Each implant is different and, in general, this is a new combat mechanic and unknown before this part of V. A goner who fights exclusively by summoned minions. As always, we need to bar the evil that has descended to earth. The gameplay has hardly changed since the previous parts. As always, we get rid of the mobs as effectively as possible by stuffing SSS kombuchs and get spheres for pumping. The leveling also, in fact, has not changed. A couple of new mechanics have been added, such as an implant arm or a combat moped. The second can be divided into 2 parts and spud enemies with it, or sit on it and move it. In general, as a slasher, everything looks very impressive and dynamic. Only the new character raises questions. Mr. V does nothing himself. All damage is done by his summoned creatures. A talking griffin with a bad temper spills mobs with magic, and a black panther performs a melee function. Even on the battlefield, you can summon a healthy golem that hits painfully, casts heavily and, in general, is a good ultimate. Also, for the easiest V, gain the SSS rank in almost any battle. Everything seems to be fine, but because of all these mechanics, the battles are drowsy. Since you don't do shit yourself. You are required to dodge in time or just finish off the enemy. The design sags a lot compared to the 2013 game. I would say sends back to the centuries of stagnation and PS2. In general, the design of locations is a problem for all parts of the series except for the game from the British. It conveyed grotesques and allusions to modern society. Also, the design of both ordinary enemies and bosses differed for the better. Unfortunately, we are back to our roots. In the 5th part of the imperishable, we have 2 types of locations. A standard American city slightly decorated with a demonic apocalypse. It looks nice, but the same species are already available for 3 hours of the game and Type the world of demons consisting of bones, shit and blood. That's all. Enjoy. If the fans wanted it, then they are still those unassuming personalities. For me, this is a clear step back. The problem is exactly the same with the plot. In the 2013 game, it was interesting to follow him, again playing the grotesque. Here we have, as always, Dante is fucked up, Nero is fucked up, and so on. The game does not represent anything interesting in terms of the plot. Just an ordinary story with very beautiful and vivid cutscenes. They are drawn beautifully, it's true. Ekshonchik, slowdowns, fucking, that already divih this game. Everything is in place, everything is in business. I really thought DMC fans had grown. I've never been so wrong. An adult is always a child inside, right? Bottom line: Normal slasher. If someone didn't stink, everything could have been much better and more modernly done. But unfortunately the fans are such fans. Now it looks a little outdated. In fact, the game does not offer anything new except for a couple of mechanics, on the contrary, it sends us back. Is this good or bad? It's bad for me. But as our publisher says. The main thing is to please the fans. And what to do for people who just love to play slashers, they apparently did not think 6.5 / 10 ",True,False

It was a better game than the first game. The character's past and present are perfectly blended and the transitions are nice. But the game has some shortcomings. First of all, there is a Dark Souls style storytelling. So the game does not tell you, you are investigating. The stories are written in the documents and at the end of the game we cannot answer. We see the name of the game producers with many questions. I think these questions should be resolved with dlc.

"Um game de combate medieval feito com muito capricho O sistema de combate é muito envolvente e divertido, sendo possível escolher o ângulo de ataque e tem várias técnicas e dentre os jogos medievais que joguei é o que mais gostei, pois é muito bem equilibrado, ao contrário de Chivalry que tinha vários exploits e glitches abusivos que acabaram com o jogo, aqui tudo isso foi consertado e aprimorado -Há uma variedade enorme de estilos, armas, equipamentos, cada uma com stats diferentes de dano, velocidade de ataque e alcance, sendo possível jogar com diversos tipos de lanças, machados, facas, espadas curtas, espadas longas, espadas de uma ou duas mãos, escudos, arcos etc.. e tem até alaúde pra tocar músicas enquanto outros se matam -Tem também uma classe que chama engenheiro e pode construir algumas coisas de cerco pra proteger o time e reforçar a defesa, como balistas, barreiras pra arqueiros, paredes ou spikes pra atrapalhar cavalos etc O jogo vem com alguns personagens padrão, mas o sistema de customização do jogo é muito amplo e permite criar seu próprio cavaleiro, sendo possível alterar cabelo, voz, tipo físico entre outras diversas coisas Conforme você joga e ganha xp/gold vai liberando novas armaduras disponíveis para a compra. Você pode comprar e alterar praticamente tudo: armas, itens, perks e cada peça de armadura, como: braço, luvas, botas, pernas, tronco, elmo, pescoço, além de ser possível alterar cores e até a matiz da cor da armadura Existem peças de armaduras leves/médias/pesadas (elmo, torso e perna), o resto é cosmético. Você pode utilizar o que quiser, dentro um limite de 16 pontos. Por exemplo um elmo leve custa 1 ponto na sua build, já um pesado custa 3. O pesado protege mais mas deixa seu boneco mais pesado e fazendo com que corra mais lento. Uma Zweihander (uma espada de duas mãos) custa 10 pontos. Então você pode usar o que mais combina com seu estilo, variando o que quiser e montar uma build dentro desse limite de 16 pontos, levando em conta as armas/armaduras e perks Sem contar que o jogo é muito cômico, existem várias linhas de voz e cada uma delas tem várias frases diferentes, além de um comando que você pode gritar quando for atacar ou só pra brincar Impossível não falar também da otimização, jogo muito bem feito com a UE4 e incrivelmente polido e leve Os modos de jogo são bem divertidos: -Frontline: 32vs32 e você sente que está em uma guerra medieval mesmo, pois conta com cavalaria, armas de cerco e com mapas e objetivos diferentes. Já tive batalhas épicas e situações muito engraçadas -Battle Royale: não consegui testar pois está com problemas nos servidores, mas parece muito divertido, e com certeza vou jogar bastante apesar de não gostar de jogos desse tipo, pelo estilo de jogo de Mordhau acredito que combine muito bem -Horde mode: funciona com até 6 players contra waves de bots. A cada wave você ganha gold e pode comprar equipamentos melhores pois os inimigos vão ficando mais fortes e vêm em maior número. Precisa de alguns ajustes, no entanto, é bem divertido brincar de Joffrey atirando com uma besta em cima de uma torre em Mountain Peak nos bots que não sobem escada No matchmaking são esses e também tem TD, Skirmish e FFA nos servidores da comunidade -Personagem feminina: Já foi falado que será implementado, e espero que seja mesmo e logo, pois é triste um jogo com tamanha customização não ser possível mudar o sexo da personagem; -Falta um modo de cerco de fato, em que um time tem que invadir um castelo e matar o rei e o outro time tem que defender e resistir por X minutos. Esse jogo tem potencial pra um modo desse e seria incrível pois mount blade warband tem e a experiência e imersão é surreal. Esse realmente deveria ser o principal modo do jogo, e não Frontline, apesar de ser super divertido também -Seria legal um modo de torneio medieval (Justas) com os cavalos -Um modo de duelo 1x1 (Apesar de ser possível duelar assim em servidores não oficiais FFA de honra que normalmente o pessoal respeita, eu já até criei o meu e tive ótimos duelos, mas é essencial um no matchmaking) Obs: os devs já falaram que vão implementar em breve e assim espero -No modo Frontline a customização dos times podia ter mais tonalidades das cores, pra não parecer todo mundo muito igual, então podiam adicionar mais tipos de vermelho e mais tipos de azul Os devs são bem atenciosos, pois o jogo veio com muitos problemas nos servidores e não estava dando xp/gold depois das partidas, e isso já foi resolvido. Só falta arrumar o battle royale e expandir mais os servidores, pois está tudo lotado e isso tudo eles estão fazendo, toda hora comentam e fazem anúncios e estão trabalhando sem parar desde o lançamento, ou seja, são bem diferentes de outras empresas famosas e grandes que lançam um jogo cheio de defeito e demoram semanas pra resolver, além de não responderem ninguém Essas empresas multibilionárias com orçamento pra jogos AAA que só pensam e lucro e cortam jogos pela metade (lançando o resto em forma de dlc) sem qualidade a preço abusivo e cheio de lootboxes deveriam aprender com esse pequeno estúdio de 10 pessoas que fizeram um jogo muito melhor e com muito carinho e apenas com dinheiro doado no Kickstarter. Estou feliz pelo sucesso deles ! Aguardando Bannerlord eternamente, mas agora muito viciada e contente com Mordhau !",True,False
"Recommendable! I love this game, and it's a worthy successor to ThemePark Hospital. Yes, that from the good old days. With an update recently everything is completely in German, and let's be honest, they did it really well! But now about the game itself and what I think is so good about it: As already mentioned, it is the successor to ThemePark Hospital and it is partly made by the same guys. And like TPH it also plays. You get an empty hospital and then you have to build different treatment rooms there. Doctors, nurses, caretakers and assistants have to be hired and of course the patients should be cured. Research can be done and personnel must be trained. Since you run out of space at some point, you can buy add-ons if you have the budget. With every hospital new tasks are added, but the basic principle does not change. And that's just as well! Because that's the way it is in the hospital. There are people who complain that what happened is going to happen again. Yeah sure! What else? That's the way it is in every simulation! As I said, the tasks are becoming more demanding and at the hospitals where I am now it is pretty difficult to get into profitability. But you always manage to do it. I play the game so that I get 3 stars on every hospital mission and only then move on. A hospital like this sometimes takes a few hours before my goal is reached. There have been a lot of people who want more micromanaging. I just say: No! That's exactly the way it is, because MM hardly changes the game, but only complicates everything. I don't want to work, I want to play and relax! Pros: + The graphics are really good in their style. You can see and see everything well. ++ The animations of the people are great! And the interaction with all the machines and objects is great too. + The music is well chosen. At first I thought that she would get on my mind at some point, but nope, I don't mind at all. ++ The speakers are great, especially now in German! + Managerial options are fully sufficient, you can hardly keep up with the things that you still want to do. Neutral: ° You can copy treatment rooms once you have built one and save yourself a lot of time. Unfortunately, they have to be built once per hospital. It would have been nicer if a library had been built up and you could then look for a basic framework for the room, even if none of this room has yet been built in the hospital. ° Too many messages pop up for me. You are forced to build in pause mode in order not to get behind schedule with the news. If you want to read a message and you are currently in construction mode, you either have to cancel the construction mode and then start all over again, or you can continue building and accumulate a whole bunch of messages. That's why I always build in pause mode, which I don't find so nice. Yes, you can also automate some of the messages, such as a promotion that can also run automatically. But when I want to decide for myself, the info area is pretty annoying. Negatives: I couldn't make out really negative things. The game is running and I haven't had a bug either. There may be a few little things here and there, but I won't think of them until the next game. I just enjoy the game. It reminds me of its predecessor, which I still have on the record and could play right away. But this game here is made with so much love that I definitely won't fall back on the old camels. The price for the game is completely okay. And I'll get the DLC too. Yes, that costs around € 8. Yes and? It is an extra and an extra can also cost something. Just because some people think that they can get anything at Humbelbundle for $ 1 (those misers, because you could pay appropriately), they don't have the right to ""ask"" for a DLC for nothing! So! Great match! Buy recommendation, for everyone who likes to play a business simulation that doesn't go quite so in-depth, but is funny and entertaining! ",True,False

"This is a very simplistic game with very low resolution and could have just as well have  been  named, ""Welcome to anywhere"" because it has nothing to do with what Heaven is like or how to get there.  WARNING!  WARNING!  BIBLE THUMPER ALERT!  Yeah, you guessed right.  I am one of those right-wing radical Christian conservatives.  Don't worry, I am not going to get all religious on you...but the facts are that this game has no clue about heaven or judgment.  As a game, it reminds me of some of the old 8-bit games I played with computers first came on the scene.  Most of the time is spent walking from one person to another and listening to their ""confession"" of sins and their excuse for committing them.  If you play the game just as a game that is not related to heaven, it is worth the price I paid...which was ""free"", and it might fill a few hours of your life with entertainment better than just sitting around doing nothing.  If you are looking to learn anything about actually how to get to Heaven, it teaches nothing.  I had really hoped for at least some attempt to have some Biblical information interjected in to the game, but found none.  My time in game shows to be only 0.2 hours, but I have additional time playing it on my other account and could find very little redeeming value in it's content.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 3 only because it reminds me of how simplistic games used to be.  I wish I could give it a better rating...but then I would be committing a sin for lying.  :) ",False,False

"Each divine patch with a sledgehammer destroys the balance of the weapon and after 90% they run with one fart. Departures will be until the next patch note, and after its installation, new ones will appear.

"I played this game years ago. I admit that I spent quite a bit of time in PWI, as I made many friends there and every now and again I still listen to the PWI music. However, I can't recommend the game to anyone else. In fact, I advise for anyone considering this game to stay the heck away from it. Here is why: 1) This is a Pay2Win game. It's as simple as that. 2) The PvE is garbage. The content is crap, same boring, pointless, often mis-spelled quest dialogue, followed up by more boring, unoriginal quest dialogue. 3) The PvP used to be the reason to play PWI, but the thing is, unless you pay real money to gear yourself, you will never be able to compete with the others on the PvP field. It's not a skill thing, it's not an rng thing, it is very simply a money thing. If you don't pay, you don't get end game gear. Pay money, get viable end game gear. 4) Game currency doesn't drop, ♥♥♥♥ exp gains, ♥♥♥♥ gear unless you pay real money for gear.  I am a bit nostalgic when it comes to this game, as I remember sinking countless hours (and many, many dollars) into it back in the day, but the new version of PWI isn't even worth the download, imo. The game is old, a lot of the features that were in it before were removed (character creation is looking really lacklustre... didn't there used to be more hairstyles??). I don't know what happened to the starting villages, and the entire game just feels extremely dated. I remember this game fondly through rose-colored glasses, but PWI as it is now is just a waste of time and money. TL;DR: Game is dated, old, boring, garbage. PvE is absolute crap. PvP is Pay2Win. Gear in the game is Pay2Win.  PWI is just a garbage Pay2Win game. It's crap and it's not worth wasting your time on. ",False,False

"it is a who, unfortunately, is also. The positive aspects of this game are undoubtedly, in my opinion, the ability to carry 8 weapons all at once and the originality of the maps.

In this game it is high, as if you don't pay you are not strong and you can't get kills, making the game a total waste of time and a source of frustration. I absolutely do not recommend this ""game"", if it can be defined as such (I would define it more as a heap of useless files), also due to the fact that there are similar games that are very well made, both, but not, but also classic paid games but that bring you all weapons / characters / items etc. available. etc. right away (as it should be). Another, but less relevant, negative aspect is the slowness of the gameplay: in a game of this genre, speed should be a strong point and not a feature to be neglected or omitted.

"Among Us is a game with an idea that has a lot of potential. Unfortunately Among Us lacks mechanics to reach a great level of potential. This is because of how Among Us is designed, which leads to most matches progressing by blaming and ejecting others without evidence.

This leads to a novelty experience and any charm that Among Us has wears off quickly to people who prefer to think first before acting.

You have the Touge and Faceoff ""tournaments"". Here's how they work: You need to win a 1-on-1 race. Three times in a row. On the SAME EXACT TRACK. I will not really even try to explain here why this is NOT a tournament mode, but merely a ""hey, you know what's fun? beating the same race, three times in a row"" brainfart of an idea someone came up with at a design meeting and walked away really proud of themselves.

"The clearly overpriced game Montaro stands out due to the popular Internet dog, emoticons with her, skins, again, for her, expensive cards and this is where the pros end. Next comes the incorrect generation of levels, when, having fallen on a banana skin, you can fly upstairs, walk through the building, again fall onto another skin, failing to jump over it, fly onto the roof again, and so on until the lives run out. As a result, Pösel turns into a spinning something that is a pity to look at. The game puts in front of the player a bunch of traps that are placed completely incorrectly, sometimes there may be several deadly traps in a row, which in theory it is impossible to jump over and survive, because after each jump, two seconds must pass for the dog to jump again, at the same time it continues its movement ... straight into the hatch. As you could already understand, the main problem of Montaro is in its curve of jumping mechanics and level generation, which is critical for a platformer, Pösel can step and jump late, and another time he doesn’t have time to jump to the point and turn up again on some kind of skin or falls on a crow, which is tantamount to death. In short: this is a disgusting game, the only thing that saves her is this aforementioned dog and the ability to steal panties from Japanese schoolgirls (there is even an achievement for collecting 802 panties ^ _ ^), which play the role of health units here.

"The introductory part of the game described above was very well done. Although the game's virtually gloomy to horror atmosphere has virtually disappeared from the game, it is still a joy to play thanks to well-written dialogues. Technically, the first impression of the game was also good. Compared to its predecessors, Lorelai often uses a combination of 2D graphics and 3D effects, and especially in the initial locations, it looks really good. Also, the dubbing of all the characters finally sounds professional and it is perfectly complemented by the music used. But after the first two chapters, it turned out that the game didn't really offer much. The plot is moving fast, too fast! It gives me the impression that the game was released very prematurely. The authors either ran out of money or a muse, quite possibly both. I often wondered during the game why this and that part of the game is so strangely done, there must be something missing. And I still have that feeling even after three finishes and getting all possible achievements. You can come across objects that are really useless or puzzles so light that they can not be considered puzzles, but rather cheap cotton wool to prolong the game. It doesn't matter much about your choices during the game either, it is simply not possible to reach a bad end here, while in previous games it was standard. I'm guessing he also fell victim to the early release of the game. The whole thing might not matter so much in itself, but if the game was not so short at the same time, it's over in a few hours and you will most likely not come across the jam at all.

There was plenty of everything there, and the local administration always spoiled us with their gifts, compensating for all the SHIT that this game is on the official servers.

I played for five years, you greedy fucking fucking pigs, without donation to the Korean grinder, so that in the end, just fuck everything, because there was no transfer date. An excellent scam, fuck you bitch, the server is shit by the way, if you don't have 500 bucks to buy paper armor, which is only suitable for milking in a pissy Vyron Vordoi.

"Mafia 2: Definitive Edition Now that I've played and finished it, is it worth trying, over the original? Short answer is: not really. The game has improved in some ways, but only visually, and it's not a huge improvement. Things that you'll notice if you played Mafia 2 Classic before, is that the game definetely looks better at night, but what you could also notice is your framerate being much lower even though game hasn't improved a whole lot visually. There are bunch of small details that indeed look better, such as character models, some magazines and stuff. I think the game is worth trying if you have played the Classic before, but if not, you shouldn't, because there are many bugs that you'll most likely encounter that could potentially ruin your experience. Definitive Edition introduced many bugs which haven't existed in the original version of Mafia 2, such as NPCs stucking into walls, or falling into the ground, and also, the eyes of characters are really glitchy in this version. There are a couple of cutscenes where someone would have a conversation with you, and instead of looking directly at your face, he'd look to the right/left or up, which is a bit ridiculous. That being said, I cannot recommend this game in it's current state, hoping for the developers to fix the glitches.  Conclusion: Don't play it if you're a first timer. If you have played the original Mafia 2 before, you might aswell, since you got it for free. ",False,False

Game is just not worth playing at the moment. I don't know if the developers stopped trying or if they are just really bad at programming. But the state of the game I'm not even concerned about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game is. More on how bad it runs. The game is poorly optimized and in particular moments the game keeps shutting down. About one or two times per game the servers can't hold up and you get a frozen frame for a few seconds that often results in the game crashing or just freezing your movements for about 10-20 seconds. In this game that matters a lot and ruins the experience of the game. On 3 days of playing it recently I have crashed over 20 times and had my game freeze about 25times total... Insane that the developers doesn't get a hotfix out for this ♥♥♥♥ already. Don't waste your time on this game. Not worth it ,False,False
"It's a bloody mess. I have to admit that I fell for the ""we'll listen to the community feedback"" lie, genuinely thinking that this game would go in the right direction. But it didn't. It went straight into a DLCfest. The season pass doesn't grant you access to all the paid content, Wildrun isn't part of it, and on top of that, it costs almost as much as the game itself. Plus, it gives so little content that it makes no sense to pay that much: a bunch of bikes, new specs made with recycled and/or slightly edited assets and a new gamemode which should be competitive, but in reality it's just about who glitches the most. The physics are broken, the cars don't feel alright at all. The steering capabilities also differ depending on input peripheral, with DirectInput ones having increased precision and steering radius, while keyboard and Xinput pads users get impaired controls. This issue hasn't been fixed, despite being a hot topic on the game's forums. Vehicles aren't many for today's standards and they're terribly unbalanced. While updates fix the handling of some cars, all they do is changing the current kings. On top of that, bikes seem to dominate in almost any spec and they're locked behind a paywall. Despite the major outcry on the forums for more balance, nothing seems to have changed yet. Moreover, the engine sounds are terrible. The only saving graces of this game are the graphics and the game world. ",False,False

"I clarify in advance that this game was given to me by a friend, and I am sorry to evaluate it negatively, but if it is bad I can do nothing. Need For Speed ​​is a terrible game, with ridiculous glitches and a bug-ridden setting. To begin with the slightest thing, the story; She's super silly, the characters are cartoons, I don't think there are real people who behave like that, it's ridiculous (Except Manu, I like you ♥♥♥♥♥), you run races to show that you are the coolest thing in the world. In the city, the events are divided into categories, one for each character in the story, but in practice you will only do circuits, drag races, drift and sprin, and from the police ... they are non-existent they are reduced to an epileptic light on the screen, helicopter ? Nails? Heavy trucks? No, nothing like that. The presentation on the screen is very good, although the whole game is nocturnal, so they can give more details to what can be seen, the photo mode is tremendous, the audio complies, although there is no dubbing into Latin Spanish and the soundtrack stands out for not standing out at all. Now the biggest shit in the game; the handling, like me, EA couldn't beat 2010's Hot Pursuit, with its (for the time) groundbreaking drift handling easy to do with a light touch on the brake or releasing the throttle, something that worked perfectly in this game thanks to its wide fairways, medium and open curves. This installment uses that same handling system, and it shows that they have learned something, since, despite being an urban environment, many curves are sinusoidal and sharp or angular curves are rare, but it still feels rough and imprecise, Failure to enter or exit curves is very common, this is something that in my opinion ruined Most Wanted of 2012, its urban environment with narrow streets and tight curves did not adapt well to said mechanics. They tried to innovate with the styles of handling, drift or grip… and I don't know why they did it, grip penalizes drifts, making them is more difficult, and drifting is like the best way to play, it penalizes little. But here it fails, it is frequent that just when leaving a skid the direction is blocked and it takes hold late, that surely happens in a simulation, but this is an arcade game, the nitro many times does not work and it is necessary to insist with the button. This poor handling is linked to a technical problem, when repeating an event a lot, the game crashes. The worst: the edges at the edges of the curves, there are bad unions in the polygons that form the inside and outside of the curves (this is what I think happens, but it could be something else), and apparently the car's hitbox is a cube, this makes what should be a slight scratch of the car against the outside or inside of the curve, (due to understeer or oversteer) to become a noisy accident, where by the way they recycle the crash animations of the NFS The Run , animations that play a while after the crash and that take you to a mini loading screen, which would be tolerable if it were like in The Run, that returned you to the previous checkpoint, but no, it throws you on the track, even in unfavorable conditions where you can crash again, this game is a parody. And what led me to write this negative review, the game requires a permanent internet connection for everything, no matter how you play you must be connected, but even if you have good internet, they can take you out because EA's servers cannot with 12 users connected (if it has servers, it looks like p2p) and if you have an unstable connection the game will also take you out, wherever you are. A pity because this game carried the responsibility of being the restart of the franchise, but they accelerated a lot and ended up with the engine burned, an engine that by the way is complete crap, if there is one thing I remember Frostbite it is for ruining games and entire franchises. The game has good ideas, the dramatic camera angles when drifting, the graphics are actually good, even now, the silly story has some great personalities from the automotive world, the online mode is fun, but There you will see if not, since you have to play connected to the internet yes or yes. It could have been a great reboot for the franchise, but it stayed as a mediocre video game, I don't think this will improve anymore, that's how it will stay, it hurts. ",False,False

"Hmmm... how to rate this one?  Well, it's got a few fun hours in it, I'll give it that, but it seems less and less fun every time I come back to it.  I will admit though, Tera has the best combat system of all MMOs I've played and that's one major reason why this game even sparks any interest in me anymore.  Aside from that, I really gotta tell ya, En Masse Entertainment has done an absolutely excellent job at eliminating any sort of actual randomness, fun, or individuality from this game.  It's Free to Play so they must also think that means ""Free of any fun to play"". I came back this latest time to try out the newest class, the Valkyrie.  The last time I played, I started just as they were introducing the Gunner.  It seems that every time a new class is introduced, it's OP as hell.  So, you can tell that leveling a new Valkyrie and defeating enemies was about as fun and challenging as stomping on an ant hill.  I'm still not all the way to 65 with her yet (yes, ""her""... the Valkyrie is limited to Castanic females only.... also similar to the Gunner which is limited to Castanic or High Elf females, or the Reaper which is limited to Elin, a race of all females... not sure what to make of these race/gender limited classes yet) but I'm not sure I want to continue.  Things have been so cut and dried in this game it's not really that fun leveling anymore. For one, there are no random loot drops anymore.  Anything that does drop is either currency, mats for enchanting, and maybe a surprise lock box.  I haven't opened any lock boxes yet because I figure I'm just going to be disappointed... and because the keys aren't cheap.  But the point is that there used to be at least a few gear items that would drop so you could at least swap out pieces of armor or weapons here and there, or even use those weapons and armor to help gear an alt or even use those extra pieces to create a unique look or something.  But nope... all of that's gone and what's left is a field full of cookie cutter sameness amongst everyone leveling.  Boring.  Costumes are available which allow you to turn what you're wearing into something that looks completely different, but most of those are $$$.... did I mention this game was F2P? There's also the lack of anything to do besides leveling while you're out in the field.  Sure, you can hunt things, but once again... no loot drops... so why?  Well, for that almighty experience that is.  Because the devs want you to get to endgame to do more grinding for actual gear drops in dungeons.  This appeals to me just about as much as sticking icepicks under my fingernails.  Not only because the gameplay has been boiled down to how high you can get your gear score, but because that number is then used by others as some sort of gauge of your skill, which it is not. Leveling is as simple as ""Kill a few of those creatures"", ""Kill creature for item"" or ""Talk to that person at that place""... probably to boil down leveling to such basic mundane tasks that you can do these things in as little time as possible.  I mean, hey, it's Free to Play, right?  Why give premium content like ""interesting stuff"" away for free?  There isn't even any real reason to stop to work on crafting skills because by the time you work your crafting skills up high enough to craft the next level of armor or weapon or whatever, you've out leveled it.  But if you examine the crafting system in depth, it's almost like the game is designed to severely discourage you from crafting in the first place.  You have a daily limit of crafting points (which are used up even for mundane tasks like gathering or mining, as well as the actual crafting of items)... once those are used up, you are disallowed from any further crafting and you have to wait until those points very slowly replenish over the next 24 hours.  But you should know better anyway... the devs have made it clear that crafters are weak and stupid and you should really be out fighting and leveling like a good little drone. But ya... so if you're one of those ""Gotta get to end game so I can group up with other toxic players to repeatedly run dungeons to gear up my character so I can stand around in a group of all similarly geared characters just to be able to run other dungeons and get more gear to look slightly different until everyone has that gear too!"" then this game is definitely for you! At least the overly sexed up girls are something to look at............................................... (until you get bored of that too). And what's with the hands on these female avatars anyway?  You got super hot pole dancer strippers with more curves than an F1 racetrack for avatars, but they have these super huge, unsexy, disproportionate, gangly, mutant, ape man hands!

One of the major issue are  - Screen Flickering  ( If you want to play need to change Full screen too Windowed or Borderless. Else sit back and enjoy the never ending flickering fun in every 10 sec ) - Integrated graphics card  ( The game App.exe  is default set into your integrated graphics card need to change in order to play )  -  Animation  ( The Character models facial quality was terrible along with some annoying white wash shades ) - Price  ( I got it along with AC odyssey S pass but the current price point they are selling this MOD AC3 is not at all acceptable) The only Pros which i felt while playing this Mod is some 7 year old memories but that you can still get by Re-installing your Original AC3 . Rather than wasting money for this crap!  One word to UBI please don't ever think about Remastering the Black Flag. If you call this MOD as your Games Remaster .. ,False,False

"It's one of those cases where a game is built with a ""story"" and supposed ""variety""""freedom"" and it still feels lacking. The developer sold it cheaply and appears to have  moved to a different project, which is unfortunate. Algotica would never be the best example in this genre, it is entertaining nonetheless. it's crazy to say, but i still sort of enjoyed, something as unpolished as this. The hud sucks, the story is better ignored, a few levels were rushed, there is an overall lack of content.  Yet, i was close to recommending. I certainly do encourage getting it if you find a cheap deal for it. Seriously...this game is short, it aint worth 5€. You write a command line, basically you just add a series of already existing imputs to a list. The point will be to move the little robot towards his destination. Ideally you want to waste as little memory as possible.  You could write commands from point to point, except you need a certain amount of memory to advance to the next stage. Each stage has a few levels and the consequence of doing so wastes memory. Instead you have to take into consideration that the program loops once it finishes. Alternatively you could also write a sub function, repeated an X amount of times and add it to the main program. This until you reach the final stage (2) and unlock all the commands. With those unlocked, you could add commands like Foward (X times) that cost no additional memory. Neat game, it just ain't finished ",False,False

"It would seem like an ordinary game with the simplest mechanics ""three-in-a-row"", but with complication in the form of a team, which is under ""our control"". In this team there is a directly fighting man with a health level parameter and two of his girlfriends, the influence of which on the direct gameplay of the first is not sensibly explained. Yes, although there is an FAQ in the game, it is in the form of icons that an ordinary player does not want to decipher at all. Did the authors of the game think that the game would be understandable without words, or did they just trite a few dollars for a font suitable for the game's visuals? It is not very pleasing that with each of our attacks, the zombies immediately follow up with a counterattack and the next move the zombie attacks again. What the hell ?! What is it like?! I absolutely do not understand why the enemy moves against us in fact two times in a row? Okay, then why can't our brave man also give a small response in response to a zombie attack like the enemy team? Or is it because he is white and needs to be oppressed in this way? As a result, instead of trying to collect squares with an attacking ""ability"" you have to rake through the mountains of garbage squares of our hero's friends for the sake of green healing squares, and it turns out to carry out an attack or not - already as ""squares will fall."" The visual is pleasant, without vulgarity, with the corresponding pleasant pictures in the achievements - those who like decorating their profile on Steam will like it.

"This is a great game, but I HIGHLY advice against buying this on steam. While it is one of the best GTA games, the PC port is terrible and it's gotten updates over time which literally breaks the game. Rockstar has over time lost licences to audio tracks in the game, so certain songs have been removed from the game, but the programming still thinks the song exists, which means that every time the game tries to play one of the removed song, the game will crash. This means that every time you enter a vehicle, or a shop, or any other place that plays songs from the radio, you're basically RNGing whether to crash or not. This is fixable by downloading unofficial downgraders to bring back old game content, but even before this was an issue, the game could crash for other reasons since it's made for older operating systems. So while this game is awesome when it works, I can't recommend it on Steam. ",False,False

Their spray goes all over the place and then one last magical shot hits the head (This occurs every 9 out of 10 kills I see).

"I was a big fan of the Governor of Poker flashgames back in the day. These games actually learned me how to play poker. One of the aspects of the game it learned me was bluffing: Raising your stakes without actually having good cards, but making your opponents think you do.

"A really good game in itself! The idea behind it is great and it's also a lot of fun to play with friends. Unfortunately, many unnecessary bugs ruin the gameplay. So the snow map is completely bugged. Cold damage cannot be restored by fire, but sometimes it can. It is impossible to have 2 SAVE GAMES on both maps at the same time. If you have a save on Map 2 (Forrest), you cannot create a SAVE on Map 1 (Snow). You spawn directly in Map 2 and die. The only way to delete Save 1 so that there is only one memory available. The game has been around for over 2 years. The developer cannot get these small errors under control after such a long time. This is a complete game break bug that makes the game impossible. The ice level (Map Snow) is designed for luck. Either you're lucky with the loot or you shit in it. You should strike a balance here and make some things more user-friendly: As soon as a new patch comes out, I'll change my review. NOTE: There is a bug where the player gets stuck in the ground after a Bigfoot hit. I even fell through the map! This has already happened to another player. Would really give the game a thumbs up, but currently there are too many bugs. ",False,True

"Unfortunately I can say little about the game. Since Capcom does not solve the problems that we are having many users, for which, the game crashes us, returning us to the desktop, and whose only option (as a solution, found by the players themselves, since Capcom has not lifted a finger for fixing nothing), that is, manually delete the video files. With which we have an incomplete game. Thanks Capcom, for ripping us off again. About the game: the dubbing is one of the worst in the world of video games. In short, my recommendation: do not buy it. EDIT: Capcom or AMD have fixed the problem with the videos. We can start the game now. Now we just need to solve the other hundreds of bugs that the game presents: rendering problems, stuck character, immortal enemies, etc ... They got the name wrong, it should be: Bug Planet 3 ...

"Steer clear of this game. First of all, even though the download for this game is 3GB in size and includes the full game, you are still required to install origin and make an account with EA to play the game, that is already on your computer. You cannot play the game that you legally purchased on steam, on steam. Why even sell it on steam? Strong-arming people into using your client is neither a good business model nor a good way to convince them to use their client. I bought the damn game on Steam because I want to play my games on Steam, and because I purchased it through Steam, there is a certain expectation that 3rd party DRM won't be so intrusive that it will get in the way of playing it. This is strike one. Okay, so I begrudgingly set up the origin client + account, which takes up 15 minutes of my time (15 minutes that I could have spent playing the game if EA knew how to run a business properly), and then I attempt to start up the game, but wait! I get a black screen! Why? Ostensibly because my monitor is 240hz capable but is running on an HDMI connection that only supports 120Hz max, and the game must be attempting to run at that refresh rate, which won't work because, again, this is an HDMI connection. On top of that, the game has no settings, internal or external, that allow one to change it to run windowed or, I dunno, change the framerate to something I can actually use. Strike two. Finally, after nearly an hour of struggling with the game, starting and closing it repeatedly like an insane person, somehow I actually got a picture. Couldn't figure out how to get out of the house and lost interest before I did. I probably lost interest because the process of even getting the game to be in a playable state was so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I was tilted before I even began. I'm not really feeling that this game is worth $20 + an hour of troubleshooting. I make $12 in an hour at my day job, so you could say the real cost is $32.  Anyways, there is no strike three. I can't recommend this game. Not on steam. If you want to play it in a sane fashion, get yourself a 60hz monitor and buy it through EA's storefront, since they want you to use it so desperately. There is literally no point in buying it on Steam. You'll just have to bury yourself in dozens of clients and go insane trying to keep track of which game you have on which storefront so you don't accidentally buy a game twice. I'll try playing the game again some time later when I'm not pissed off, but my recommendation won't change. ",False,False

"""Warface: Ice Breaker"" I will rate a little about the game and then I will give you my point of view and recommendation. Graphics: 4/10 - If you have an AMD graphics card like me, don't bother trying the game because my card is 1 GB AMD graphics card and the game doesn't run well, I have to put it on low and everything is looks very very blurry, has very poor performance on AMD computers. Sound: 4/10 - The copy of Battlefield and Counter strike together. There are very similar sounds of weapons between these games and they really sound very fake ... it has good sound quality with headphones but everything sounds very fake and really blurry graphics and cheap movie sound, ew. Game mode: 4/10 - As I said it looks like a copy of Battlefield and CS: GO, I expected something more but it seems that I was wrong, the lag is deadly when you use AMD and that is what bothers me the most, it has nothing new to other FPS and the worst thing is that it is pay 2 win, in a moment I will talk about that in my recommendation. Final rating: 4/10. My recommendation ... I cannot recommend the game positively because it has nothing new, it is a copy of other FPS's that came out before and it is pay 2 win. What do I mean? That you have to pay for everything if you want to win, free weapons and armor are disgusting, they look like paper! You are a plastic soldier and many call you a hacker just for playing well, as I said ... Do you want something good? pay 300 pesos up, just look at the dlc's .... those packs are the best and look at the price. It's a shame that such a game, which had a lot to promise, fails us all. But it is a free game on Steam, most are always Pay 2 win. ",False,False

"First off i would like to say i know i dont have alot of playtime on PC, i did play this game on console and yes i did complete it.  This game was fantastic on console and i waited a few years to buy it on PC so i could replay it after a long long break and im a severely disappointed in what the PC PORT is like. Below i will say why it is a terrible port and why i do not recommend ANY pc player to play this. In my 1 hour of playtime on this game all it was was launch game, crash (either origin or in general steam), crash, crash, crash, crash, crash..... you see my point. When i did get to play the game it got FAR worse.... my fps was below 40 almost every second with the occasional below 25 fps. I also encountered freezing in cutscenes and EXTREME fps drops and when i say EXTREME it was to the point of 7-19 fps...... WTAF is that. To top that off i got stuck in dialogue options/choices due to the freezing e.t.c. When i was running around the starting area my game crashed on me 4 times due to low fps and other issues with this terrible port, enemies would randomly turn invisible and continue hitting me (yes in the tutorial area) and my resolution would not go to my monitor.... it would constantly change my resolution. TBH in my 1 hour of playtime i think i only played about 10 minutes of the actual game. Now, i have a great PC with great specs and this is by far one of the worst PC ports i have ever tried in my life and it is a shame as this game is fantastic and i would recommend it to people but not as a PC game sadly in this state.  The only good thing i can say about this game is play it on a console, its story is fantastic, the animations are on point and  the gameplay is awesome. Also you wont have any issues on console the way MOST pc players did/do. Overall i am ashamed to have purchased this on pc, i should have listened to the community with all the issues they were having with this game.  On pc its sadly a 2/10, but on console its definitely a 9/10 must play. ",False,False

"Game based on the TV series ""Barygi"". I cannot recommend the game, although I spent quite a lot of time in it. There is very little positive in the game, unfortunately, the pumping of the team at the beginning, the plot, with sidebars from the series. It is very surprising at the beginning how the order of the move was made here, each move we do one action, with one unit, then the same opponent and so on in turn. You can get used to it, but it plays strangely. The main disadvantages include the unfinished nature of the game, it was clearly abandoned along the way, all these experience points, money, the number of mercenaries were screwed up, but they did not decide what to do about it. Enemies here are hopelessly stupid, they can stand for several moves while we kill them or run up to our group at close range. Well, if they hit us, we run to the side and, wiping the sweat from our forehead, we are treated, such an animation here, it's funny (no). The plot is linear, we play first for DEA, then for a drug addict, the differences are minimal. Cards are also not pampered with variety and instantly become boring. In both companies, there are 9 main story missions, in order to proceed to their implementation, you need to complete 4 side missions. In general, everything is as always, the game is based on the movie = we blind on the knee fast, the main thing is the Name. p.s.

"You're a KGB officer guarding a secret lab. However, you witness some murders, so, now, your fellow colleguas and soldiers are chasing you through Moscow to shut you up for good... I'm not saying no to a FPS that could be set in the past, with all the fantasms the ex-Soviet Union can bring. However, here, I think that for a Russian FPS, it could have been a little more accurate historically... Anyway, the plot is not really what I could call the main point. The Stalin Subway is a FPS, certainly outdated graphically but it's not really that the problem. The big problem of this game is the slowness to load, if it's loading at all. Man, even saving and coming back to the game takes a long time. This is the most bothering point, because I'm pretty sure that without that, it could have been more pleasant. The controls are really reduced to the essential, so, it's not like you have thirty buttons assigned to something. Because it's funny to see the gravity in this game: how the bodies are flying around, how you manage to pass a box through a closed door (yeah, graphic problem) and how to try to crawl into a higher vent is reminiscent of some games where you need to jump and crawl.... it's a shame that the game can be so frustating with that slowness. Even coming back to windows to try to kill the process when it's too long is a problem. The soundtrack is good however, too bad the sounds aren't really following. Why am I not going further in my review? Because I think that the AI is correct for a game released longer than 10 years ago. At least the enemy AI because NPC tends to stay in your way. It's not possible to make them move (unless you kill them) and seriously, some of them could have been placed elsewhere (not in front of a medical closet for example). But the main reason is because I know that I will not finish that game as it's a pain in the ass for loading a save. I'm not there to wait 5 minutes with a still screen (or a black one) to enjoy something. I'm just now playing to get the rest of the trading cards.

"Publikum Da Black Squad ein reiner Taktik-Shooter ist und es dort ein Levelsystem gibt wo eigentlich ein Matchmakingsystem regeln sollte das Neulinge gegen Neulinge und erfahrene Spieler eben gegen Ihresgleichen spielen sollte das Publikum doch eigentlich weitreichend sein.

Selbst wenn ein oder auch zwei erfahrene Spieler dabei sind wird das Ganze nicht wirklich besser da das gegnerische Team meist aus einem kompletten Clan besteht, welcher sich natürlich meist über Sprachprogramme wie Teamspeak koordiniert. Also wird man hier inoffiziell dazu gezwungen einem Clan beizutreten, es sei denn man möchte Runde für Runde verlieren.  Grafik Die Grafik in Black Squad ist für einen Free2Play Shooter in der heutigen Zeit eigentlich recht gut, natürlich ist es keine Augenweide aber die Grafik sollte bei so einem Spiel sowieso keine wirkliche Rolle spielen. Also in diesem Punkt macht Black Squad nichts falsch.  Schwierigkeitsgrad Wie soll man den Schwierigkeitsgrad eines PVP-Spiels bestimmen. Schließlich gibt es nur echte Gegner und je nachdem wie Diese spielen fällt dann die Schwierigkeit der jeweiligen Runde aus. Also kann die eine Runde gut laufen da man eben relativ neue Spieler als Gegner bekommt oder man hat eben keine Chance wenn man gegen übertriebene Clans spielt. Alles in allem überwiegt mittlerweile die Zahl der Veteranen im Spiel da Neulinge wegen dem nicht vorhandenen Matchmakingsystem schnell die Lust daran verlieren.  Bugs Im Spiel selbst gibt es eigentlich sogut wie keine Bugs, immerhin sind mir persönlich keine aufgefallen. Was jedoch immer wieder mal passiert: Sobald die Entwickler ein neues Update rausbringen ist das Spiel aus diversen Fehlern für viele Spieler nicht spielbar, also das Spiel startet erst gar nicht wegen Fehler X oder Y (verschiedene Fehercodes) oder stürzt mehrfach im Hauptmenü ab. Diese Fehler werden meist aber nach einiger Zeit behoben, was aber auch teilweise länger dauern kann. Im Compatitive Modus, also dem gewerteten Spiel hat man da leider auch gelitten wenn man durch Bugs rausfliegt. Denn wer ein gewertetes Match verlässt bekommt Strafpunkte (was an sich ja nicht schlimm ist da es schon scheiße ist das jeweilige Team im Stich zu lassen, vorallem da in diesem Modus kein Anderer nachjoinen kann). Natürlich hat man die Möglichkeit schnellstmöglich wieder ins Spiel zu gehen und dem Match wieder zu joinen. Leider kann man kurze Zeit später wieder rausfliegen und kommt man zu spät zurück und das Match ist vorbei hat man eben gelitten und bekommt die besagten Strafpunkte und das nichtmal aus eigenem Verschulden. Wenn man dann auch noch mehrfach diese Strafpunkte bekommt kann man für diesen Modus gesperrt werden und das nur weil die Entwickler nicht in der Lage waren diesen Fehler zeitnah zu beheben. GG.    Gameplay Leider hat sich das Gameplay sehr stark verändert. Zu Beginn von Black Squad hat es einfach Spaß gemacht, man hat mit netten und lustigen Leuten und gegen nette und lustige Leute gespielt. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war es auch egal ob man gewonnen oder verloren hat, wieviel Kills man hatte oder wie oft man gestorben ist weil der gesamte Umfang einfach stimmig war und Spaß gemacht hat. Mittlerweile ist das Spiel einfach die reinste Katastrophe geworden. Eine gigantische Welle aus Cheatern und Flamern hat das Spiel leider komplett zerstört. So wird man rund um die Uhr beleidigt, der Tod oder andere unschöne Dinge werden einem gewünscht, man wird sexuell belästigt oder zugespammt das man ja nicht so spielt wie andere es wollen. Hat man selbst eine gute Runde wird man als Cheater bezeichnet, hat man eine schlechte Runde ist man gleich der größte Noob und soll doch das Spiel schnellstmöglich deinstallieren. Wie man es also macht ist es verkehrt. Selbst mit welcher Waffe man spielt wird in Frage gestellt. Nimmt man Sturmgewehre oder Mps ist man ein Spraybot, spielt man mit Onetap Waffen (Einzelschuss da sie sonst zu stark verziehen) hat man Aimbot oder Wallhack an.und ist eben der besagte Cheater. Der Großteil der Spieler aktuell sitzt aber mit Scharfschützengewehren in irgendwelchen Ecken da diese Gewehre ziemlich overpowered sind. So braucht  man mit jedem normalen Scharfschützengewehr lediglich einen Schuss und der Gegner ist dahin, egal ob in den Körper oder in den Kopf. Mit der Schrotflinte brauch man aus nächster Nähe schon 2-3 Ladungen, Realismus wird hier großgeschrieben. Die Entwickler kümmern sich überhaupt nicht um diese Probleme. Man hat zwar die Möglichkeit über solche Spieler Tickets auf der Support Seite einzureichen, aber wirklich was dagegen getan wird nicht. Außerdem gibt es Mechaniken im Spiel die störend waren und nach Wünschen der Community doch bitte rausgepatcht werden sollten, laut den Entwicklern wurde dies getan -> wurde es aber nicht.  Spielzeit Die Spielzeit in Black Squad ist eigentlich unendlich. Denn wie schon erwähnt hat es keine eigene Story und basiert auf Teamkämpfen die jedesmal anders ausfallen da man andere Gegner auf anderen Maps bekommt. Das Spielprinzip bleibt natürlich immer gleich da man eben immer die selben Aufgaben hat, aber das ist ja auch der Sinn eines PVP Shooters. Manche verlieren schnell den Spaß daran während andere nach 2000 Spielstunden solch ein Spiel genauso feiern wie nach der 1. Stunde. Also liegt die Spielzeit hier an jedem persönlich. Umfang Der Umfang in Black Squad ist für so ein Spiel in Ordnung. Es gibt jede Menge Waffen, Skins, Charaktermodelle, einige Maps und den ein oder anderen Spielmodus. Das alles reicht auch eigentlich für eine solche Art von Spiel, sofern es gut umgesetzt werden würde und anschließend mehr auf die Spielbalance und Spielmechanik gesetzt werden würde. Die Entwickler hauen zwar in größeren Abständen neue Waffen und Skins raus, aber das ist leider auch alles. Anstatt sich um ihr Spiel zu kümmern und den eigentlichen Spielspaß zu garantieren werden lieber am Fließband neue Waffen bzw Skins rausgehauen die manchmal mit Ingamewährung erworben werden können aber meist dann doch eher für Echtgeld in einer Art Glücksspiel beim Kisten öffnen. Natürlich muss man dazu sagen das das Ganze Free2Play ist und das dies die einzige Möglichkeit für die Entwickler ist Geld reinzubekommen, aber trotz allem sollte man sein Spiel doch guten Gewissens dem Publikum zur Verfügung stellen und nicht einfach ""Da habt ihr, macht was ihr wollt, hauptsache ihr kauft die Skins"".sagen. Immerhin kommt es genauso rüber. Schade, denn das Spiel hatte Potenzial. Preis/Leistung  Die Preisleistungsbewertung kann ich hier nur gering vergeben da Black Squad wie schon erwähnt ein Free2Play Spiel ist. Es gibt im Steamshop kostenpflichtige DLCs welche neue Waffen und dessen Skins enthalten. Diese sind allerdings ziemlich teuer, da man bei den meisten nur eine Waffe mit einem exklusiven Skin bekommt, daher würde ich, sofern man eben diesen einen Skin unbedingt möchte auf einen Sale warten und es dann im Angebot kaufen. Ich persönlich bin an dem Punkt angekommen, wo ich die DLCs die ich gekauft habe gerne zurückerstattet bekommen würde was aber leider nicht mehr geht. Ich werde das Spiel nicht mehr anrühren. Mittlerweile kann ich auch jedem nur von diesem Spiel abraten. Nicht unbedingt aus dem Grund das die Entwickler nicht die Arbeit und Liebe reinstecken wie sie es eigentlich für ihr eigenes Produkt sollten, sondern eher wegen der vorhandenen Community. Denn ich glaube niemand möchte in jeder zweiten wenn nicht sogar in jeder Runde dumm angemacht werden weil es anderen Leuten nicht passt wie man spielt und diese direkt persönlich und beleidigend werden. Man sollte nach wie vor nicht vergessen das es sich nur um ein Spiel handelt und nicht das Leben davon abhängt, aber für manche Leute ist es wohl so. Fazit: 1/10 möglichen Patronen",False,False

Gott ist tot. Nur die Karawane der Jäger, vom Stadtvolk als Scheusale bezeichnet, reist noch umher um den Bestien und Monstern Einhalt zu gebieten, in der Hoffnung nicht selbst der Verderbnis anheimzufallen. Ziel ist, den verwesenden Leichnam von Gott endlich zu beseitigen, damit dieser die Landschaft nicht weiter verpestet. Die Jäger die man dabei verkörpert, haben keinerlei eigenen Charakter. Sie sind also beliebig austauschbar. Dadurch kommt keine Bindung zur eigenen Gruppe zustande. Die fehlende Vertonung kostet das Spiel massiv Atmosphäre. Hier müsste ein Darkest Dungeon Sprecher her. So bleibt das Spiel aber eher fade. Die Kämpfe wirken belanglos und man kämpft  im Grunde eigentlich immer gegen die selben sieben Gegner. Am störendsten fand ich, besonders in einem rundenbasierenden Kampfsystem, dass Gegner die mich erspähen einfach meine Züge unterbrechen und dann direkt handeln können, während wiederum die eigenen Charaktere in Form von Wache halten oder so, das eben nicht können. Das größte Problem von Alder’s Blood ist, dass es nicht schaffte mich zu fesseln. Die Geschichte ist einfach langweilig und ich fragte mich öfter, warum ich es überhaupt weiterspiele. Es wirkt einfach alles nicht bis zum Ende gedacht. Ich glaube auch nicht dass weitere Patches daran noch was ändern können. Von mir bekommt das Spiel leider einen Daumen nach unten.

"Really liked the graphics and style of this game.  Nothing too fancy, but looks really awesome nonetheless (despite some of the ""Naziness"" other people mentioned).  Also got it at a discount during the last winter sale, so for the price, thought it was ok. However, I really can't recommend this game unless the controls are fixed.  There's no way to customize key bindings, and the defaults are just impossible to use on a laptop with just a standard keyboard and mousepad.  Perhaps having a real mouse would improve gameplay, but I'm not willing to buy a mouse just for this game. Got stuck around the 21st shard with the moving crate on water because I lose control of the cursor/levitation when the animation for the trapdoor starts.  By the time the cursor shows up on the screen, the little box is already in the water and the trap door is already closed again. Have tried every combination to get back control of mouse/cursor/levitation at the point, but it just doesn't work.  So that's pretty much as far as I can go in this game because controls don't work properly for me and key bindings can't be customized correctly. Story wise, I actually thought there would be more content than what we got, but it's not that big of a deal, again, considering the price when I bought the game.  With only one episode realeased so far, it's pretty hard to guess where this will go in the future.  Sounded promising at first, but actually kind of ""meh"" right now. I hope these will be addressed in future releases.  Until then, thumbs down from me. ",False,False

Delta force series is also important to me, but it doesn't even cost 1 lira. Unfortunately, the game could not live up to that nostalgia. Someone said that 4K resolution or something, do not be fooled. 800x600 resolution is the maximum. Even in the first mission, when I was about to find the last guy and whiz, the screen froze, it didn't turn off, I restarted the computer. I will return this version does not work properly.

"Dont let the time fool you, I only just recently had this game linked with my steam account. I played to around level 30 before hand because all of my friends had this game and it was free.  I was not a big fan of it then, and im not a big fan of it now. Why? Well for starters it is NEEDLESSLY complex, everything is just bloated and silly. The passive skill system is way too daunting and is boring and mundane. The loot system is garabge.The gem system is a cheap and silly idea, It gave developers a lazy way out of making an interesting skill set. I perfer more focused loot systems (Diablo 3/borderlands style so grain of salt). You get so many useless items in this game it hurts. And playing tetris in your loot bag is asssss. So speaking of Diablo 3, I see ALOT of reviews for this game compairing it to Diablo 3. If you cant afford Diablo 3 then this game is fine i guess. But Diablo 3 is many steps higher than this game. People say ""look how many maps PoE added!"" Quanity DOES NOT equal quality. In Diablo 3 everything has a purpose, feels focused, and most importantly is an absolute blast to play! Pros: Free ( yes like completely so kudos to that) The art is... fine? Cons: BORING Horrid loot and skill system Lazy sound design Cheap knock off enemies Bad UI Always online (which relax I would say the same about Diablo) Stupid gem system Silly and bloated all around So in conclusion I would not even bother with this game, get Torchlight 2, which I would say channels the old school loot rpg feel way better than this, or  get Diablo 3 (with reaper of souls because duh) if you want a newer take on the genre!

"includes many genre and is probably best described as supernatural/fantasy/slice of life Visual Novel. I'm honest with you guys, I played it just a few months ago, but I already can't remember a single thing about the story, only that I felt like falling asleep out of boredom, and I'm sure I even did fall asleep for a few minutes. It's always a bad sign if something simply fails to be rememberable after such a short time. That only happens with titles that are neither good nor bad enough to be actually remembered in any way. I don't know about you, but that's how it works for me, at least. So, if you expect to read a fleshed-out review, I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. I can't tell you much about the story or characters anymore because I simply can't recall anything except for the beautiful visuals and the fits of sole boredom that got a hold on me more often than not, but I would like to warn you that you probably won't get anything out of reading this paper-thin story, except for admiring the gorgeous artwork. This is not a hidden gem, even if it may looks like it at first glance. The text is displayed as a wall of text instead of a classic text box. You probably know that kind of text representation already from the highly acclaimed  . One might feel overwhelmed by the amount of text since there is simply too much to read at once before it goes over to the next transition. I already disliked the wall of text in  , and I only started to read it attentively after installing the PS3 Patch, which transforms the wall of text into a classic text box. However, the   is more than a decade older than  , and what many people seem to accept when playing   due to the good plot, as well as the hype, is probably more difficult to achieve for a relatively new Visual Novel like this one. The text presentation made it even more difficult for me to follow the shallow story, and I lost the desire in it quite soon. Admittedly, I'm kind of biased since the art is absolutely stunning, and that always catches my attention even if the story is not that interesting to begin with. I think it's not an exaggeration to say that this is one of the most beautiful looking Visual Novels here on Steam. I mean just take a look at some of the CG's; if those aren't beautiful then I don't know what actually is. Some Visual Novels that lack great storytelling can still convince me and are able to leave a positive impression on me when the graphics are beautifully illustrated, but the story has to be at least a bit intriguing for that to happen. Sadly, the artwork is the only thing that kept me going, otherwise, I would have just skipped through the whole game. I was hoping that the plot would show some kind of improvement over time, alas that did not happen. It's nothing you haven't seen before and especially if you've watched your fair share of shounen anime,   is probably going to be a tedious experience for you as well.  There are just too many aspects that make it impossible for me to truly recommend this Visual Novel. Missing features like a voice-over, a user-friendly interface, or a gallery are just a few honorable mentions that would doubtlessly turn it into a more enjoyable experience, but first and foremost   is lacking a captivating story that would make it worthwhile to torture yourself with the amateurish writing that is far off from being well written.

"It's difficult to review Metro Exodus. It is undoubtedly well produced, the graphics and sound are just amazing. Realism and Atmosphere it has in oodles. But so far I am one hour in and I have done little more than hit Q a few times, and a couple of minutes of shooting. This isn't really a game, it's more an interactive movie and even then it's only interactive in the commercial breaks.  Now I know this could be said of many of the Metro titles, but I dunno, maybe my memory fades, but I am sure none of them had this degree of ""movie"" content. To my mind this game fails just on the fact that there isn't enough game-play. I think when you are this far in to a story, you really need to do something a little different and decreasing the game-play was not the right thing to do. If I could vote ""maybe"" for this game I would but since Steam insists I vote yes or no, it will have to be a no. ",False,False
"The game itself is not bad, but it is very broken, one class is much higher than the others, which forces you to use it if you want to have a ""fair"" game, and in addition there is almost no player playing, so it is difficult playing an online game due to the delay (and sometimes there isn't even enough players to start the game and you end up having to leave the game or play with a bot), and when it works out that the games are filled, it will almost always be the same people, so if you have a camper in one match you will surely find him again in another, if you find someone who abuses the class, you will surely find him again too. Summary: The game has potential, however they need to balance the classes and implement a crosplay (so there will be more players playing), that is, it is better to wait for them to fix these things first, otherwise their experience will not be very good.

"Lol, making CS:GO free and adding battle royale doesn't make your cheater-riddled game any better, if anything you have made it worse, well done.

Oh and by the way, never make a paid game free to play if it still has a huge active community. All of those people didn't buy and support your game for you to make it free when players become less interested in it, it's just a huge slap in the face.

"It's very mediocre game, that's the best I can give for this game. There's nothing memorable, that's worth mentioning or even recommending this product. i only had some of fun time sniping enemies, but that's about it. Boring, dead open (however pretty small) world with same locations - some outposts that need clearing by shooting 5-10enemies, when you clear that outpost there's nothing else to do in that area, boring characters, hastily done upgrading and crafting system. You can compare this game with Far Cry 3 / 4 in a way, only that this game is at least 20 times worse. Graphics are mediocre too, very blurry, sh*t anti-aliasing, there's ton of graphical bugs even after all the patches. It's super monotonous game, not even worth buying during the sale. I'd give it 4 out of 10 and the only reason I'm giving it this much is that sniping was kind of fun, for a few hours... It gets boring after 5 hours or so and you'll just probably delete. P.S. It's extremely unoptimized. High-end rig with gtx 1070, R5 1600, 16gb of ram and I'm getting only 60-73fps with some drops to 50-45fps on 1080p, very high settings? Come on, CI Games....

There is even musical accompaniment, which is undoubtedly a plus. But, in general, this particular game did not catch me in any way, so I can’t leave it a positive review.

"Well to start I want to clarify that I had a lot of doubts in recommending it or not, and in the end I opted for NO. Then I explain: Let's see ... first of all, this is a game purely and exclusively for those who have PATIENCE! and why do I say patience? simple simple ... the amount of bugs and errors that this game has is enormous. The times that I just closed the game is incredible. The driving is terrible, apart from the fact that you only drive almost always the same car, it is very basic, there is not much interaction with the steering wheel, at times it becomes very boring to have to always be driving the same thing. There are missions that let you drive a truck with luck. Another thing that bothered me was NOT BEING ABLE TO REPEAT THE MISSIONS. Please people, we are in 2017, I want someone to explain to me why companies make fun of us so we get a game so bad. Unlike FAR CRY, every time I try to take control of an outpost, the enemies regenerate again so to speak. IN ALL MY LIFE THAT ALWAYS CONQUERED AN ADVANCED POSITION, THIS SAME NO LONGER APPEARED. It is the first time that happens to me in this game. It is also incredible that you are in the middle of a mission and suddenly it goes out or gets stuck. What would be the positive in this game? Good: Unlike the other Sniper Ghost Warriors, I must say that I was surprised that it was an open world, I highlighted that a lot because at the story level the other 2 seemed very boring. I liked that idea ... they gave a quality leap in that sense. The story has high lows ... at times you get sad, at times you get happy, but I want to clarify that it leaves you sincerely much to be desired. I was surprised in some parts although the truth is the story is very predictable. Conclusion: ONLY BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE PATIENCE AND DO NOT WANT TO BREAK YOUR MONITOR. ",False,False
"All in all Fallen Order™ is a nice parkour game based in the Star Wars™ universe. The lightsaber™ fighting is done well too. It only has one but big downside... a main story playtime of around 12-14 hrs. Not really much for a 60-70€ game. To artificially counter this the devs took fast travel out of the game and combined this with a useless holomap and a really horrible map design. There's usually only one way to a certain part of the map. So if you want to go to a location at the end of a planet's map you have to run through all locations before (""hose maps""). Back and forth... over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. This combined with the game mechanic of ""from here on you can't progress on this planet any further (bec of missing skills), please fly to another planet and come back later"" leads in the end to more running back and forth than in Death Stranding.  My total time of 34 hrs split up into 4 hrs idling trade cards, 14 hrs main story and 16 hrs running forth and back on the maps... and that's not even a joke (especially the part with the trade cards). :/ ",False,False

I've never flown a real helicopter so I can't really comment anything definitive, but on the most realistic ""pilot"" flight model setting and the joystic sensitivity at maximum I don't think it's too bad. Probably still a bit more stable and forgiving than what a real helicopter would be. The bigger problem lies elsewhere. While the older sims were about trying to create at least semi-realistic scenarios, this game is simply all about blasting away tons of enemies with unlimited weapons in scenarios that have nothing to do with realism. If the mission is about ""taking out enemy artillery positions"", in practice it means that you'll take off (simply by applying full throttle), fly for something like 800 meters and engage the literally 30 guns that are scattered all around in the terrain. If you run out of ammunition, no problem. Just push a button and all your weapons are magically reloaded. There's no damage modelling, both you and the enemies just have a simple health bar (which you can hide if you want but technically it's still there). There's no avionics or targeting systems or anything on the helicopter, all the enemies are simply highlighted on the screen with red triangles. Over all it's clearly just a very simple shooter game that just happens to involve a helicopter. If you're looking for a helicopter sim with ANY degree of immersion, stay away from this one.

"I didn’t expect such a trick from my respected manufacturer of strategy games. The ""company of heroes"" of the first part, which I played with pleasure and in which, in one of the add-ons, even the Germans were treated with respect, without touching upon the horrors they did during the war, suddenly turned into a ""company of villains"" in the second part of the game, where they showed all the horrors that the troops of the USSR were doing and where Stalin is essentially equated with Hitler. But dear developers, if you did not touch on the topic of Hitler in the first part, what was stopping you, or rather what prompted you, instead of showing the heroism of soldiers, to show something that is not subject to glorification? Many of us know the history, the unsightly facts of the Second World War, and when buying a game, most expect to enjoy it, and instead feel rather a feeling of disappointment and disgust. Is this what you wanted the players to do? If so, then you have achieved the goal, and I, in particular, regret the money I spent. Now about the recommendations. If you take the game for the sake of multiplayer, take it, if you liked multiplayer in the first part, you will like it in the second.

"Remember that cool game from 2013? With interesting pumping, progress, goals in the game, funny co-op? So, unfortunately, these memories will remain in 2013 ... for 6 years wollay ""licked"" the game, and as a result removed from it everything for which the game was loved: c In theory, the beta comes after the alpha, but in this case the alpha comes after beta To make it clear what I mean: 1) The character leveling system (XP, Skills, etc., etc.) was removed from the game. In the game, the goal of crushing mobs has disappeared 2) Now the entire game map is divided into zones in which you complete quests, explore the world, kick mobs and bushes, getting loot for it. It seems to be fair, BUT ... when moving to the next zone, all your gear becomes a piece of shit, because all the loot that is farmed in a lock will be tied to this lock. Only artifacts retain their properties (Which give such buffs as: + 9% to running speed or +2 seconds of breathing underwater (Useful, right?)).

"To make things as brief as possible this game looks decent (oldish graphics but clear and crisp on my VIVE pro) and the game play concept is fine and seems fun.  This is a sit down game where you have to lean right and left to steer and that is what I had a problem with. Not the sit down part but the leaning part. My VR legs are pretty strong and I was getting very queasy and had to stop playing. Read on please. I am not expecting the developer to change the game now but it would have been much better to actually steer the bike with the hands rather than leaning. Steering with one hand would have been fine and handing the weapons with the other fine. Missed opportunity I guess. Body or head steering is awful in my opinion. The player has to look around while leaning at times and that is what got me I guess. I don't know for sure but I was feeling ""sick"". Very unusual for me. I hate to give this a thumbs down but if you are prone to motion sickness this may not be for you. It could be that I was not playing it correctly or something so try Hell Road VR out for yourself before passing this by. I think it is worth it if you like riding on a bike and decimating undead.

"It was the first question that came to my mind when I saw the review ratings, and it didn't mislead me as usual. As someone who liked the first two games, I got the third one with the same enthusiasm because my goal was to both complete the series and play this game with a different gameplay style. However, we see how to destroy a series in this game. As we know from previous games, our main character is Lucius, who serves his father (Lucifer). We were sent to a health clinic after the mansion we grew up in burned down in the first game. The third game begins with the detective investigating the incident bringing us back to our town. In this game, the producers made a ridiculous map system like 'let's make a change, it is like a semi-open world but with restrictions, people cannot do whatever they want'. We get their hearts by killing the crows we see around, and in this way, we can fast travel on the map or we can fly by turning into crows thanks to the heart we collect (yes you did not read wrong). If you collect them, there are 15 locations on the map. As always, there is a certain course of quests in the game, if you get bored and go exploring another place, the game will somehow prevent it (locked doors, necessary items, etc.), so we have to go according to the task, so why is the game in a town if I can't roam free? We can use our telekinetic power very little in the game, as there is almost nothing in the game that we can interact with. The way we kill the characters is quite simple compared to other games and does not require effort. The game is so problematic that there are some things that happen as soon as they are told, just like that. No matter how much you change the sound settings in the menu, the sounds rise and fall on their own in the demo and in the game. For example, it's annoying when the sound of a home cooking stays there throughout the game. I mean, what happened? They said, `` Let's change the images in the second game and make a more mediocre image. As if the game came out in 2008, not in 2018. Npc's getting into the objects in the environment, going under the ground, inside the wall, sitting in the air, etc. These are common things we encounter in the game. We also have a lighting problem, when we enter a house, even if the lights are on, it looks very dark, no matter which indoor area you enter, this is the solution, the solution is to resize the game and load it. If you are too lazy to take pictures, a couple of episodes like me are in the dark, but you can turn on the light in the settings and play. Our recording system is legendary, the game is auto-recording frequently and opens a separate recording at the end of the episode, there is no manual recording system. So if you accidentally click on the episode name instead of autorecording when you are loading like me at first, the recording in your place is gone, because the game starts by autorecording with the demo. There are bobbleheads or figures to be collected in certain places in the game, but it is a problem that cannot be ignored that a figure you collect will spawn there again when the episode ends and we can go and get it again. In this way, it is possible to do 66 figure collecting achievements in the game without any effort and without searching around. The mediocre story and killing patterns also make the game intolerable. So I mean, if you think 'let me complete the series, let me play', stay away, you may go mad. ",False,False

"I haven't played single mode for more than two hours and I'm fed up. There are games with a good plot and atmosphere that compensate for their shortcomings even when they are painfully average. On the other hand, Homefront, despite its bold presentation of the presented world, does not make up for many of its shortcomings. This is the only game so far where I have seen Extermination Camps, ruthless soldiers, ordinary citizens dying in front of our eyes from disease and hunger, it is a vision of a real dystopia under the tyranny of monsters engulfed in propaganda, not humans. Overall, the creators set themselves the goal of showing a bold and brutal vision of the USA under communist occupation. It is certainly exaggerated, but it is interesting nonetheless. The story where the DPRK attacks the US seems naive, but I do not rule out that I would change my mind if I were looking for newspaper snippets from which we can dig into how this catastrophe of the American dream happened, but I had no desire to do so. The characters we meet are not convincing and are only there to guide us further. They say something and have their moments in which they try to show that they are also supposed to be alive, but we still do not pay attention to them and we go on whenever possible. The entire campaign is scripted. It is true that the Call of Duty series is famous for this and is one of my favorite series, but it is done really well there. In this game, the scenes felt artificial in places. This feeling was magnified by a really large number of mistakes. It's been a long time since I met so many in an hour of play! Korean soldiers are stupid and killing more usurpers is not fun, despite the worst shooting pattern. As for a short game, there are even a lot of weapons, but during the campaign we will often change weapons, because ammunition is like a medicine for each separately, which is sometimes annoying. Not a single piece caught my ear, and the music on the menu gives me the feeling that this is a budget game. The graphics for 2011 are ugly. The textures do not please the eye, the animations are average and sometimes there are errors in the visual setting, such as a glowing figure as if it were after a solid dose of radiation. Homefront is a bad game. Guerrilla fights and terrorized USA are an interesting idea for a plot. Unfortunately, in this case it was lost. If bugs were fixed and a few things were tweaked then it would even be quite a title in a single player campaign. But I was positively surprised by the multiplayer mode, which is quite good compared to what the story mode presents. Unfortunately, it is on the verge of natural death due to the fact that there is usually only one server where 10 to 30 people play. I did not have high expectations, but Homefront gives the impression of a budget game, like in games from a kiosk. I will not say, because I had fun with some of them, but that was many years ago, and the requirements increased. I do not recommend buying it, but if the game is already in the library, you can check it. ",False,False

"- Action adventure game. - Great singleplayer length. - Detailed Lara Croft. - PC gamers get the Definitive Edition early. - Save checkpoints are very nearby so you won't have to retry a large part of the game just to get past it. - Story meant for children. - Menu designed for consoles. Hard to use menu with the mouse. - Too many cutscenes. I wanted a game not a movie. - This game has more cutscenes (cutscenes that can't be skipped) than you think it has. Almost I have no control over Lara for 20% of the game and over camera for 30% of the game. I can easily see it because I'm the more stealthy type gamer. I always take small small steps. And what do you know, Lara was walking on her own a quarter of the path. - Lara chooses to crouch or go out of crouch on her own. - Too much button mashing. The game also shows you a hint that says 'mash buttons' as if it is a great gameplay feature. No shame at all. Why do I need to press a button 20 times to open a locked box or a locked door that is going to get opened anyways? Is there any gameplay here other than a workout for my fingers and my keyboard? - Quick Time Events - Even though Lara Croft was quite detailed, all other characters in the game allies and enemies both weren't given much development time. - There is no 'need' to collect collectibles. I just picked up whatever was in front of me and that was enough. - I only killed one deer. I didn't hunt the rest of the game. Don't understand why they made the deer hunting so dramatic when there was no need for hunting for the rest of the game. - Most puzzles are time-based. The solution to the puzzle is very easy. But you will have to retry it multiple times to get the timing right. Some hints were actually misleading rather than helpful. - There were some jumps where Lara couldn't realistically make it but still makes the jump successfully. The gravity defying physics is quite ridiculous. Too much jump assists. - Early game there was a part where you needed to find a path to reach a place. When you leave the base camp to search for the path an old Japanese music starts playing. Naturally follow the music and you find a hidden path. After reaching the other end the music disappears. My question - who was playing the music and for what reason and from where? I never found out. I lost interest in the story so early game. - I like video games more than movies because video games can be more realistic than movies because video games do not suffer the technical issues of the real life camera. The real life camera has so many issues like motion blur, depth of field(focus), water drop effects, lens flares, etc. These are all issues of the real life camera. A human eye in real life doesn't have these issues. I don't understand why the gaming industry considers these as features and not issues. I have to mention this point because all of these were more pronounced in Tomb Raider compared to other great games. Play some e-sports game like Dota 2 or CS:GO, they don't have camera effects. - How can I play multiplayer if there are no players? 7/10 ",False,False

"If you were to look at Blade Stranger's roster, you might think you're in for a bit of fan service fun. I mean it does have a nice stacked roster. You have a roster featuring characters from Gunvolt, Shovel Knight, 1,001 Spikes, The Binding of Isaac, Cave Story and more. And it has some really nice looking 2D sprites for the characters, along with some decent 3D backgrounds. It looks all in all like a proper 1vs1 2D fighter. Except... It's not.  The most important thing about a fighting game is also one of the biggest things that is wrong with this game. The fighting system is about as barebones and simplistic as you can get. While each character has different moves and animations, they all control exactly the same. there is no variety in how moves are performed. Hell, all of the specials are tied to 1 button. It's sort of like they tried to do something like Smash Bros., but tying it to a 2D fighting game. Smash Bros. can get away with this since it is a platform based fighter, adding a major dynamic to the way the game plays.. the ability to move on a larger scope. But when you have a small stage with no platforms, this style just does not work. You need variety in the way moves are performed. It's just not fun, and requires little memory to master any of the characters. The only positive to this would be that for the inexperienced, it makes for an easy fighting game. That's not to say fighting against other players can not be challenging, but it does require a lot less discipline and training, and it makes things like single player far too easy. For those looking for a challenging fighter, there are a lot of other competent fighting games to choose from.  I will say though, it was quite thrilling to see Shovel Knight fight a small girl riding a giant furry cat. I mean, the characters here are at least fun. If you can find the game cheap enough, it might be worth a look just for the crazy cast of fighters. But otherwise, I'd avoid this one. ",False,False

Let me explain, it only takes a few tens of minutes of exploration and object pickings to fill an inventory whose limit is not fixed by a congestion as in the classic Elders Scrolls but by a number of locations available. Of course, it is easy to resell these objects to make a few pieces and free up space but quickly a reality is imposed on the player, it is the craft objects that take up the most space and to be separated from them is prohibited. indulge in the various crafting schools. Fortunately the subscription, for about ten euros per month, solves this problem by granting the player a bag or inventory reserved for craft items whose space is unlimited. without taking my head too much, which didn't even work because, looking back, I was disgusted to manage to subscribe to take advantage of a basic functionality, a manageable inventory that is not a brake on my gaming experience. Having made little use of this month's subscription, I gave Bethesda 12 euros in addition to the 20 for the game, come on, it's a gift. I'm not very MMO at the base but I wanted to try the one of Bethesda which will not have managed to convince me either despite beautiful graphics, cool dubbing ... We do not find the difficulty at the beginning of the game as in the other Elders, the mobs are not threatening (for an assassin). Moreover, what is this delirium with these values ​​used in game (HP, damage etc.) which are counted in tens of thousands from the start of the game? I find it odd that a character starts with 16,000 HP from the start, that his attacks inflict 5,000. I find this scale of values ​​confusing and impractical. This game is clearly not for me but I do not regret having tried it, I just regret the 20 euros of the basic game, given the virtual obligation to take the subscription, the f2p model would seem more appropriate to me . I am very disappointed, I who had the hope of finding an MMO to my liking and without a ""forced"" subscription, the game already costs 20 euros anyway! Good luck, Good luck! Grilvhor ",False,False
"Best Early Access game ever to be released IMO, have had more successfuly development updates done than DayZ in like less than a year, got hooked.

"""Bloody Walls"" is a pure time killer. It is needed first of all for achievement hunters, because they are all very light there, as well as for those who wish, ahem, to warm up their evening for a free 30 minutes. Maybe an hour, at least two. Any component named ""Bloody Walls"" is made cheap and cheerful, starting with its distribution model. So the most budget version offers 4-bit picture in the style of the first ""Game Boy"". In this case, splashes of blood bring brightness to the game very handily. The most royal version is replete with more saturated 16 bit. Clever, don't you think? The same can be said about the design of the levels, which has gone cold: boxes, corridors, other boxes, flasks with mutated embryos, one door associated with the ending of the game. All the salt of ""Bloody Walls"" in the destruction of zombies. Here is a typical seed about the unscheduled settlement of a mertvichinka in the n'th secret complex. You are given 6 floors of a scientific laboratory of the same width (3 more will open later). The first floor is the only safe place. There you meet a motley group of survivors: a busy general, a doctor, a head in a flask, a girl, a fat man, a scientist and a merchant. Five people will ask for a specific item on one of the floors that matches their type. Well, seriously, why should a doctor not need a first aid kit? To please everyone is useful for gameplay, because mini-economics is encrusted in it. Here is the maximum weight of 20 kilograms and some strange currency (looks like bubbles). ""Bloody Walls"" is very well drawn for any kind of plot. Unfortunately, the creators were too lazy to even finish it. The finale ends with a rude ""to be continued"" .., forcing you to regret the time spent irrevocably. The game isn't bad, it's just raw. ",False,False
"Ranked is a mess. People vote for no reason, people don't follow a general strat for games which is watching blood bags, taking a note of who has which item and listen to who's accusing who, but that really isn't the problem. The problem is people who hold personal vendettas that carry from game to game. Because the ranked playerbase is so small, players in one game tend to get queued in the same game every time, and that can lead to frustration by someone who has been on a losing streak. One instance I had today was a player who got pissed at me for winning an Infected game against him, since no one would believe his claims that it was me. Every since game that I got into afterwards, he was in it. He would accuse me right out of the blue first thing, tell other people I was trash and a quitter, and tell them that I'm infected with no proof. The last game of ranked that I played, I got voted out round one because of this because this player was accusing me over and over again, and I had to defend myself because he was attacking me. He used this to say that I was trying to kill him, and everyone voted me. I'm just trying to play the game the right way, the way it should be played, and I'm really frustrated. On top of that, I got a two week ban which I'm not sure why I received it. I try and play the game how it should be and people say they report me for throwing their games. Not sure what I should be doing differently. Regardless, that was my last game of Deceit, and I'm sorry that it ended on such a bad note. I've had a lot of fun playing the game and some people have to ruin it for others. TL;DR Some players in ranked hold vendettas against people from game to game, and ruin the experience. There's no way to combat this unless you just stop queuing for the day and hope they don't get on at the same time as you. ",False,False
"What could've been some ""minecraft modpack standalone kinda game"" with farming, building, processing ressources, turned out to be a pathetic update lacking, ""bad russian dev"" stereotype kinda game.  Updates just aren't updates. Just look at the ducking patch notes (for real just look) and feel how professionally this game was made (sarcasm) .  They don't care, they're just in for the $$. Devs don't even answer poor guys in the forum or not accurately, because guess what, their english is worst than mine. (I'm french for god's sake) This game kinda pissed me off, cuz i'm a simple survival game player, i don't need outsanding content on day one, i understrand what early access is all about, i need a stable solid base (Which the game kinda had on day one).  Empyrion did that for example. Unturned did that > For those saying that this may be some one man dev and that he may have a hard time.  I liked the game on day one. But it ducking hasn't changed at all. It's still the same ducking experience you do. Having fun with 15 machines growing ducking bananas and you're done, no automation, no ♥♥♥♥. Nothing whatsoever. Sure building is fun, go ducking buy minecraft okay?  If there's one thing i hate it's when devs actually don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about people that enjoy their game. ""IllusoryWorldEntertainment"" Yeah, that's all in the name, Illusory updates, illusory bugfixes, illusory changes. It's all a ducking troll. This game shouldn't have ""Mostly Positive"" reviews, it should get a ton of sh*t in the face, because when these guys are actually getting unnoticed, some people actually struggle to make a game and are getting ♥♥♥♥ reviews.  This shouldn't exist, this shouldn't be, Steam shouldn't let such guys sell products they don't even update. I mean sure it's 10$ or 6$ on sale, but after a year of developpement we're pretty much on day one developpement stage. Shame on them. So please everyone, don't buy this game, don't rate it positively, just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ until some update that's actually greater than 10mb comes out, with real content and not ducked up glitched content, where you get (rather try to get) to a dungeon and fall through the world and then your whole world is ducked and feels like you're in another dimension.  I liked this game, i hoped it would've updated nicely even if it's kinda slow, i wouldn't have cared. I even thought to myself (on day one) that even if it looked a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥, i'm sure they'll get new mechanics in, new machines, planets, stuff to actually DO in the game without it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ glitching on you. But guess what, if i'm writing this today, you can understand all that didn't happen. So please, just let StarsOne die.  It's never gonna become anything, do not hope. The game is still a ""fun"" way to kill time if you don't pay for it, but yeah, you'll get 10-30 hours of gameplay like me and then you'll see how empty it is, and that the game never really changed in any way.  Even with a multiplayer it would be empty since there's nothing to do besides farming and bulding, so if you want to build a map sized castle with a chest full of every type of ressources and 10km of banana trees then feel free to do it, but man, there's gotta be other games to do that same ♥♥♥♥ that are actually good. Hope this review will actually prevent some people from buying the game. I really do hope. ",False,True

"I got this game solely for my brother. The training course gives you the OP guns but when you get the class, you equip  BB guns.

The new update has made it impossible for U.S. to win due to the spamming of tanks that are almost impenetrable. Conclusion: This game is still in beta and shows alot of promise.

"The plot is just a liquid mess of coincidences and accidents, an absolutely stupid character, characters and characters. Just Degrode game. Optimization at the level of feces. Sho at low, sho at high one and the same fps. The exobar theorem is directly applied. It feels like a console port, many scenes look as if I'm not playing on pitch, but on PS2. The textures and backdrops are just hilarious. The levels are just disgusting and stuffy, constant scripted spawns three meters from you and gunfights at the same distance cause kidney stones to spawn and a desire to drive into the office at a rockstar and put one pebble out the window. Constantly shootouts are like scenes from the movie ""head gun"". The narration is still by the way (* faked) the whole story is miserable through flashbacks, and in the very first cut scene we are shown a fragment from the last cut scene, a great trick for an episode from series and comedies in the style of a bachelor party in Vegas, but in such a story it does not really stick ... When all this leads to the fact that you play as a cretin who is surrounded by cretins, and the dumbest coincidences occur forever, then you already want to make a drop in the third or fourth chapter. Coincidences are the beauty of this game, just scream, as if they hired like a Hollywood screenwriter for this game, but it turned out to be a crap. It is clear that they just glue the holes so as not to stretch the plot and time for passing. In short, there is no point in playing it, absolutely linear, roughly scripted, rock-star-unsuitable for a movie-stick with a stupid plot and characters. There is no voice acting, so look at the bottom of the screen on cd and catch the point. VERY COMFORTABLY. Rockstar is not like everyone else in terms of sec .. localization, so listen to Max's barriton and read the letters. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Violent louse. I keep in touch. Good localization!

"This review may only be temporary. Here's hoping. NOTE: If you're wondering about playtime, It's because I'm a heavy user of offline mode. Always-on DRM strikes again. So I finally downloaded the full retail version after playing the open beta and decided to play through the story mode before going back into multi. It gave me a choice of six options for how I wanted my Warden to look. I picked one with armor I didn't really like since it has a symbol that I did like, only to get in game and find that it didn't even use the symbol it had shown me. Seems simple enough, I'll just go back and pick the armor I liked the look of then. Or not. After looking around the ingame menus for a while I came to the conclusion that there isn't any way to change the appearance you picked at the start. Anywhere. OK, so I'll just restart story mode from the beginning. Or not. There's no ingame option to start a ""New Game"". Anywhere. OK, then I'll just go find my save data and delete it. Problem solved. Or not. After searching extensively through every folder I've ever seen games save to, users, steam\userdata, local, roaming, ubisoft game launcher, my documents, my saves, etc. and doing several searches across multiple hard drives, all I came up with were two ini files for graphics and control options. I even searched through my registry. So I figured I'd ask on a forum. Surely someone on the internet must have found the save location. Or not. After getting a few suggestions of places I already checked, someone came in and said it was probably stored in the cloud. I thought to myself, ""surely not"", as I have cloud saving disabled in both Steam and Uplay and always have. And I'm only looking for the single player save file, not the multiplayer one. I'll simply set both Steam and Uplay to offline mode and prove that the saves must be located somewhere on my local machine. Or not. The game won't even launch if Uplay is in offline mode. So it appears that random forum user was correct. I'll have to contact Ubisoft support to get this resolved. Surely they can reset my save, or failing that, it should be a simple matter to just delete it so I can start over. Or not. After waiting over five hours in line, I finally got to chat with a human being who could actually do something about this. Or not. According to my support agent, Ubisoft in incapable of changing my characters appearance, or of even deleteing my single player save game. And they have no plans to add such a feature. So in conclusion, the unnecessary use of always-on DRM for the single player portion of the game, combined with the ridiculous omission of a simple way to change your character or even to start a new game from scratch, combined with slow and unhelpful customer support means I have to give this a negative rating for the time being. And that's without even getting into the pay-to-not-grind aspects of the multiplayer, or the connectivity issues and hassles trying to get friends to actually be able to join the same game, etc. Or the price. Here's hoping they fix this and I'm eventually able to focus more on the gameplay and multiplayer issues rather than dealing with idiotic feature omissions, bad tech support, and always-on DRM.

"Just play WWE All Stars on an emulator. This game isn't even close to that. At least All Stars doesn't have microtransactions (yes you can unlock everything without paying if you're willing to do an ungodly grind). All Stars also has different movesets. This game uses presets for everything, so all brawlers use the same moves, high flyers use the same moves, etc. Within a minute of playing you can tell how rushed this game was. I would have rather had them develop this game for another year and release it in 2021. tl;dr don't buy this unless it's for a child and even then only spend $20 max as they'd get bored in 3~ hours ",False,False

"A small kinetic novella (1.5 hours of reading) about a 14-year-old girl named Olesya (Amelia) and her difficult life during her teenage years. Love, betrayal, pain, parting, tears, harmful teachers and ancestors who finally do not rummage in the life of a vulnerable teenager await you. In terms of specifics, you can't say more, let's move on to the opinion. ""I already told you what an empty plot is, eh? An empty plot is when you take the most ordinary vanilla story and tell it in such a stifling way that the reader does not really care what is happening with the heroes of the novel. Heroes suffer, lose loved ones, cry, worry And all because you didn’t begin to unfold the plot, didn’t begin to write the environment of the novel and put something original into the characters of the characters, instead of sculpting templates. When I first read this, I don’t remember who published this crap, after reading the novel, I approved it. The point is, hehe hehe ... It was a mistake. And after that, in many short stories, I began to notice this, almost everywhere you look, almost all low-budget developers do exactly one thing and too, and again, and again, and again, and again, and they think, “now I’ll cut the dough from the game, now everything will change.” The point is, I’ve read this before, and I’m not shitty. It's like water under bridge. Did I tell you what an empty plot is? "" (""Distant Scream"", Kertycal ©) Well, if no jokes, then the plot is really no. + Not only is it empty, but the narrative is full of errors. The heroes are mistaken in names, mistaken in the little things, which does not help the ragged narration. But this is not the end of the minuses, the very presentation of the text is done in a completely strange way: ""Olesya, I wanted to ask you your homework."" One sentence spread over three text boxes, considering that all text could fit in one. I don't understand why this was done ... Maybe to visually enlarge the story ... The plot itself is vanilla to the core, and in general, in what reality can there be so many ""beautiful"" coincidences ?! I don't know who might like this. Maybe girls? For, the story, to a greater extent, is designed for a female audience. Although ... no, I doubt it very much. In general, I will sum up that the plot is bad, both in meaning and in presentation. To the details. 4 GB of RAM, 2 GB of video memory and 400 MB of disk space - these are the minimum parameters, according to the developers, a PC must have in order for it to run IT. I even checked the screenshots in the store several times and began to worry that I had completely lost my eyesight, sitting out at the computer. But no, everything was written correctly. I don't know what will happen if you run the game on a PC that is weaker than the requirements, but most likely it will just start, because there is simply nothing to load the system with. The visual part is at the level of the third grader's arts - the characters are soapy and crooked, the backgrounds are the same. By quantity: 4-5 backgrounds, 0 CG. Oh, and one more thing, the game cannot be expanded to full screen (and I really wanted to enjoy ""high-quality graphics""). There is no point in talking about the musical and sound part: there are no separate sounds, but for music in the game there are 3-4 monotonous compositions. Little things, nothing good. And among the bad: difficulties with rewinding, a frozen screen at the end of the passage, semantic and spelling errors. ""Beautiful musical accompaniment, high-quality graphics and an unusual story. Which is better to see with your own eyes ..."" - this is the description of this game on Steam. It is a pity that none of these parameters could be seen personally (maybe this is a description of a completely different novel?), As well as at least some worthy plus of this game, which, for a second, is PAYING.

"First of all, I don't really like the story. Events are always the same. The only thing I love about the game is the fighting mechanism and the handling of the assassinations. We need a good plan before assassinations. Otherwise, our unplanned work returns to us as a waste of time and, at worst, death. Therefore, we must first gather information about the person we will kill. However, we need a few people among the people to do this. But of course nobody helps us for the sake of his father like that. First of all, we can help people in difficult situations. Thus, we can gradually become a popular character among the public. After receiving information from these people, we must examine the scene in advance. It is very important to learn shortcuts in murders to be committed in open areas. Because if any part of the plan is disrupted, we have to flee. In murders committed in spaces between four walls, it will be very useful to know the rear exit doors of the place and where the person you will kill is wandering around a lot. Thus, you will add mastery to your mastery. Since the people you will kill are usually composed of people who can ""Start"" the war, they are very well protected. Therefore, it is very important to catch the gap of people. It's easier to get things done if you catch it with fewer men. At the same time, getting the job you started earlier reduces the troubles that can be given to us by the forces that may come to help. For this reason, follow the people you kill frequently.

"In my opinion, the greatest thrill from the game can be obtained by playing it with friends (in fact, this can be said about all games), since the AI ​​of computer opponents is just madly wooden and they strive to troll you. Some Vadim Kozlov, the illegitimate son of Yuri Gagarin with an accent of Pierre Narcissus, asks you to share (free of charge) resources, and if you refuse, he will be offended. But, bitch, you should never be offended if he suddenly sends you south. Or when you built a city next to another power, it immediately begins to stutter about your audacity and the scale of expansion. At the same time, everything is allowed to her, and she will even begin to hint to you that they say the army is not so hot for you, so we’ll write it down. There is only one way out - to make modern Russia out of each power. A country in which your economy is bursting at the seams, extracted resources are not being realized, a disgruntled population, but, b * tch, a tough army, exceeding all the powers put together. And you absolutely do not care about the opinions of other heads of these states. You just destroy them. But it was always interesting for me to play on the other side. When it was possible to make a major economic power out of a country, maintain trade relations with some countries, constantly develop scientifically, etc. To create an empire with which other powers would simply not want to quarrel. The game has it, but it's implemented awfully. All those flaws that were inherent in the fifth part of the series remained in this game. The same limited menu of communication with the heads of state, the same stupid AI of computer bots. Seriously, this is funny. The game just changed its skin. Okay, in the fifth part, all the powers fought with each other, because wars for territory were inevitable and all that, but here the future is presented, and people seemed to remain the same, constantly threatening bastards. I do not deny that the atmosphere in the new part is not bad, new resources, it has even become somewhat more difficult to play, thanks to neutral mutants and various obstacles on the surface of the map. But this is all completely different, this is pure addon to the 5th part (most likely even 2K themselves position it that way, otherwise there would be a number in the title). And I am by no means a hater, this is just sound judgment. I seem to like the game, but there is still some sediment. ",False,False

"To commemorate the distribution of 5 million free copies, try to evaluate it. First off, Payday 2 is a shell and the DLC is real. The belly button is bigger than the belly. It's a full story that costs 20,000 won and a DLC that costs about 200,000 won. So, is the DLC that I bought with money useful? B.. Except for a few, all of the DLC weapons that came out before are rethinking. But also, the game is not balanced. In the past, when there were only 4 difficulty levels, it was somewhat worthwhile. Even without having to use only one type of weapon, it was possible to clear the Deathwish difficulty enough. Since Mayhem difficulty and one-down difficulty were added to the update a few months ago, the balance was adjusted and the DLC was upgraded, including bow and crossbow weapons that users did not purchase because they were not popular. Of course, it was difficult to clear the one-down difficulty with the existing skill combination and weapon, and the users would have to fold it or buy DLC..? In the past, it was possible to clear using a variety of weapons and various skills, but not now.. This is not the only problem.. This part is a subjective thought.. Deathwish difficulty days.. To catch a bulldozer, first catch a grenade, etc. I needed a stun that I used, but this was an interesting element. However, it was difficult to change the difficulty level.. Removed the stun, increased stamina, increased movement speed. Black-black... Another strange thing in the skill part is that there was a skill called Inspire that saves a downed team member among the master mind skills, and this is a skill that can probably raise a team member from a distance. However, instead of saving team members with a 100% probability due to the patch, it has been changed to a 20 second cooldown. The reason is that my team members are all down using the Inspire skill and use this skill to wake up and lie down to wake up again.. It seems like I did a patch to prevent forcibly progressing the game in this way, but I only know one thing and don't know two things. . Even if you raise a team member with the Inspire skill, the number of downloads does not decrease. Even if I was forced to keep it alive, I was destined to be detained faster in the end, but why did I need to patch it? Besides, the skill that I actually upgraded is a skill called the Pistol Messiah that automatically raises an enemy once with a pistol while it is down. If you kill an enemy with an existing pistol, the skill that could be revived 3 times on a master basis can be resurrected once by killing an enemy with any weapon with a patch, and this number can be reset with a'medical bag'. In other words, if you kill the enemy while you are down and recover your health with a medical bag after resurrection, you can resurrect if you kill the enemy even if you lie down again. This makes it possible for users to use the Messiah skill and the skill that can be revived at a probability, and really, very easily and forcefully break the one-down difficulty. This was the most absurd part of what you were doing. The game I used to enjoy has decreased due to this patch, so I haven't touched it anymore. In addition, the barriers to entry are high, so it is difficult to level up without DLC, so I have no choice but to find a bus room in the workshop or ask a notorious friend around for help. It's been very long since I used it, but this evaluation is only subjective, so I hope you don't tackle it. ",False,False

"I really want to give good reviews, but I don’t want any more players who buy this game will encounter the same problems as me, so I must give my story carefully. When I first entered the game, everything went smoothly and the fluency was not high. I was i7 6700k+gtx1080+64g. ASUS gaming motherboards and Corsair power supplies. Well, I think the configuration should be able to run this game with the lowest special effects. The special effects are less than 60 frames high. About 50 or so. Optimization is not good. But these are not things, the special effects take care of it. The moment I entered the town, I felt that the atmosphere of horror was in place, and I took O’Neill’s mission. When I was looking for signals on the street, I found that the surrounding buildings and cars were transparent. I mean, I couldn’t see it at all. The car can only pass the person floating on the driver's seat to determine that he must be sitting on the seat. OK, no problem, small bug, continue to do the task. then. . . . . I was stuck in the second chapter of ""Something Strange"". After investigating Sombra, there should be a call from O'Neill at the door of the armory. However, after my Sombra's investigation is over, there is no news on the phone. I thought it was that Sombra didn’t collect all of them. I actually cleared all the monsters on this map and found all the collectibles. I visited the map no less than 13 times. My current game time is 13 hours, 12 I’ve been looking for a dark shadow for hours, I’m sure I’ve found it, but the phone just doesn’t ring, causing the door of the visitor center to remain unopened. I am stuck in the last part of the side mission. It’s okay for me to play again. I will still encounter such vicious bugs by selectively picking up the changes in the order of the props. Because of this concern, I chose to give up. But I still want to say that this game is really fun, as fun as the first generation, the player's compensation psychology has been fully satisfied, especially the garbage picking system I really like, but the existence of bugs, really should not. Hope to fix it soon. Tucao: My time playing games is quite precious. This 13-hour archive is considered to be an IQ tax.

"Game is fun and challenging. Plays any songs, but has some minor issues with mouse and the sliding mechanic. Stages are very nice and slick with it following the song along each beat. So. This game is interesting. Disregard my hours played. It doesn't have much content, however, it has a inbuilt song reader that builds a map around the song you have placed in. It is interesting to some and has some cons. My one major grime with this game is the fact that you can't turn off mouse smoothing, it's unbearable if you're not used to it. Within 20 minutes, I have gotten used to it but then there's something else you need to get used to as well. The gun doesn't shoot unless there is a beat to go with it, however, it is a bit annoying when there is a wall in front of you and you can't shoot it since the beat isn't going fast enough.  - Another thing that is a bit iffy is the sliding. You slide like in any other game that has sliding mechanics. However, your crosshair gets pushed up and your screen gets pushed down (to simulate sliding, I get it), but when you get up from the slide, the crosshair doesn't go back to default position. It goes back to the sliding crosshair position and it completely throws me off constantly. - The character hitbox doesn't feel normal, it feels like you're a floating wisp with legs and it doesn't help when you try to wall jump, it just gently lobs you to the side. I gotta give it credit though. The stages are pretty insane with the right type of music. The main menu music is great, but can't be played within the game itself (unless I missed something). - The game is very close to what it should be, it's just the minor mouse issues that is driving me away. Overall, the game isn't too bad. It just has some minor problems that could be fixed fairly easily. But until then, I gotta not recommend it. Whenever they end up fixing these issues, I'll recommend this game to everyone, as the price and gameplay is enough to warrent it. ",False,False

First the software didn´t get updated to the latest version. I had do download the patch to version 4.0.0.6288 by myself. This patch was released in December and today (Jan. 13th 2019) The Steam version is still not the latest one. Shame on you Cyberlink. When selling on Steam please take care of your customers!  The performance is abysmal. I tested several games like DOOM, Wolfenstein 2 etc. but I had frame drops when streaming on twitch. I tested every option (well there is not much you can select) But it didn´t get better. XSplit offers much more options to fine tune your streaming and while using XSplit I never encountered any frame drops at all. I could steam all games 1080p 60fps without any framedrops.

BUT, this game attempts to keep you in public matches with elite players, by offering you constant experience on public matches over private matches so you can get the latest and greatest cosmetic rewards.  If you are not a completionist or don't need every bit of visual customization there exists out there, and you have some friends to play with, then I would definitely recommend this game for a good time.  The various game modes they offer allow you to switch things up when you get bored with gameplay. This game does not allow you to feel like you are completing anything, but rather feel like you are going through the same process again and again, playing a match, dying (a lot) and returning to the lobby to wait for the next match.  That's it.  There's currently still no story or single player campaign, like Quake III had.  It's just a game to pass time.  Oh, and if you don't learn how to use the secret, little known abilities such as bunny hopping or strafe jumping, you'll be a sitting duck for everyone and everything else.  A game without clear followable movement rules that allows everyone to prosper equally, no story, and littered with microtransations (and yes, still loot boxes) is no game at all to feel as though you are a winner at.  This is why this game suffers so much with people who have not been a long-time Quake Arena / Quake III player. In addition, the game's management has been poor.  Both developmentally and community-wise.  The leadership on this game has been abysmal.  Instead of good development practices and a a community manager who engages the community, there's been setbacks, less than optimal code and releases, and ignored, and even targeted community policy changes. I guess with me, its a love / hate relationship.  I love the community I have built with playing this game, the friends I have made, but I hate thinking about how miserable and mismanaged this game is by the company.  And its not in the background either, since this game is still in EA and they are always tweaking both the game and community policies.  You can't look at the game as just a poorly released game, but a poorly ongoing mismanaged game.  That in itself is a complete turnoff for me in general. Not sure what Quake III / Quake Arena / Quake LIve is and want to know about the actual gameplay?  Games are set up as matches, where 8 players are dropped into a map / level, usually arena / round shaped (not linear like a single player level), and the goal is to have the most points to win.  The game could be made up of two 4 player teams, or 8 singles, and each player has an array of weapons to pick up and use against the others.  In most game modes, one kill is one point.  The most points win. They also have capture the flag, where the same killing rules are in place, but you get points for retrieving the other team's flag and bringing it back to your flag.  Slipgate mode, where you are focusing on capturing the other team's base for a certain time period to win.  Instagib, where it is one hit one kill with a railgun (pixel perfect shots).  And other various game modes such as rocket launchers and lightening guns without any splash (self-damage) damage.  Ah, yes, and duel mode where you can pick 3 characters against another player's 3 characters, and the first to lose all 3 (playing one at a time) loses. The community itself currently is not toxic either, I'd say you'll meet more decently good people than not.  Now, if Bethesda can just figure out how to manage their community better and bring a better game where people can feel like they can accomplish something or feel like a boss after being beaten down after several matches, they might just bring this game back to life.",False,True

"This game is special. Original developer and publisher: Code Avarice Current developer and publisher: Digerati Distribution Initially the game was placed on Steam Greenlight on Aug 31, 2012 Then they had a successful Kickstarter campaign that collected $12,540 USD. (August 4, 2013 - September 3, 2013) There were issues with the greenlight campaign: ""Code Avarice already set up a placeholder Steam Greenlight page and Steam 'didn't want to send the message that indies can seek out publishers to bypass Steam Greenlight.'"" But Officially, the title got Greenlit by 8/28/2013. Subsequently, in October 2014 the developer threatened Gabe Newell's life over a Steam listing issue associated with the title.  ""harsh lesson Paranautical Activity developer Mike Maulbeck learned today when after a Steam snafu erroneously advertised his game as an Early Access title he crossed a line and tweeted a death threat to Gabe Newell. Following this outrage, the game was pulled from Valve's distribution service."" Needless to say, the developer didnt handle the situation and associated fallout well: This caused the game to be removed from the Steam store, the offending dev to resign from the studio (""Code Avarice""), the ""Paranautical Activity"" IP to be sold to another company (""Digerati Distribution & Marketing""), followed by the offending dev rejoining his original studio. On the Early Access Steam store page, they claimed ""We're planning to add multiplayer co-op in the very near future, as well as a ton more content, and of course some bug fixes and polish.""  They also claimed that: ""Paranautical Activity multiplayer is definitely a thing that is happening...We’ve been really busy trying to get MP working...The multiplayer patch will be going live before the year anniversary of the game (february 14th)[2014]"" Subsquently, the devs disclosed that they would not add a multiplayer mode. ""Sorry to those who purchased this game under the guise of the fact it will be multiplayer. We just couldn’t rebuild the entire game to make this happen, there is only two of us.” Allegedly, the devs were asking for good reviews of the game and doing some ""heavy moderating"" ie. censoring of negative critique, on their forums. The offending dev claimed he was ""quitting the video game industry.""  However, he is already working on 2 new games: ""Arkshot and Timefight Zone"" as of 4/2016. ",False,False

"Drawngeon encountered a code error twice in the first six minutes I played, both of which forced the game to close; once when trying to view the control bindings and once while trying to browse the first merchant’s inventory list. After researching on the Steam forums, others experienced similar code errors last summer and apparently the dev fixed some of those instances for players, but they should not still exist over half a year later and in the first minutes of the game. The dev is responsive but it’s hard to trust this game to ever be coded correctly when he says the problem could be from using certain names at character creation. Update: it's not; it's due to using a controller even though the game cites Full Controller Support as a feature on the product page. It happens with both Steam and Xbox controllers but not with keyboard & mouse. Another player posted their equipped items vanished after using certain classes of weapons, and I never saw that addressed.

"2D exploration action with severe game balance The features of this game are the game balance that dies with damage around 2 times and the parry that blocks the enemy's attack. The game balance that dies soon can be stressful, but the save points are properly arranged so that retries are not so painful. The problem is the combination of durability around 2 times of damage and recovery items that can be carried multiple times. Regardless of whether it is a Zako battle or a boss battle, it is very busy because you need to use recovery items every time you take damage. If this is the case, the game that can withstand 4 to 5 attacks from the beginning and does not recover is more hassle-free, so I like it. If you want to express the tension of dying soon, wouldn't it be better to have a system like the armor of Makaimura? If you press the parry button at the timing of the enemy's attack, the enemy's attack will be prevented and a powerful counter attack will be activated. However, for some reason, the counter attack is only for Zako opponents and does not activate for boss opponents. Unlike rolling, it has the advantage of being able to fight back immediately after parry, but it is too high risk and low return. Therefore, it is a pity that the boss battle is settled in the game of counterattacking while dodging by rolling like other 2D actions. It might have been interesting if I made the return bigger. I personally enjoyed it with its cute graphics and moving characters, but I can't recommend it. ",False,False

"09 September 2015 a good friend of mine adjusted the key for Bloodbath Kavkaz. To be honest, I've heard about this game before. From the very beginning, the creators hinted that the product was ironic. A funny name for a company, a funny name for a game. Everything was fine. And I started to play, and it caused no emotions, except ""what a shit"". In fact, this is a mediocre craft, trying to copy Hotline Miami a little less than completely. Why? Let's figure it out. The first thing that catches your eye is the graphics. It feels like it was done in paint in two days. This is not pixel art, but its pathetic excuse. Second, the gameplay. I didn't accidentally remove the letter ""m"" in the word ""gameplay"", because again. It's just Ripoff Hotline Miami. And Shamil (GG of this ""game"") moves unreasonably fast and gets stuck in textures. In Hotline Miami, again, you felt the character, but here it feels like I'm running Flashham. The shooting is terrible. Departures and problems with achievements at the start is also ""not a bug, but a feature""? I doubt. Moreover, they will no longer cut Freeroom mode and Multiplayer, but they promised. Then saw all the modes before the Release, and do not do bullshit. Moreover, there is DLC, which will be reviewed later. What DLC, if the game is not really finished ??????? Third, the plot. Lord, such a masterpiece story, 10/10 !!!! NO!!! NO!!! And NO ONCE AGAIN !!!! The batch is as follows. The main character, Shamil, is sent on an assignment by False Putin to kill the leader of a large Caucasian gang. We meet different personalities along the way. And that's all. But it's not that simple. The main problem of the plot is that nothing is remembered, no moment, except for the moments where you kill video bloggers, Maidan, Maddison himself and memes. But this is what the developers wanted. Thanks to meme lovers, Tru-Pitards and just haters of Youtubers (who are not very popular now) and Maddison lovers, they broke the bank. But only a few memes mean anything to the plot. And besides, they are not the first freshness. Bravo. Briefly about the soundtrack. He's not bad. Just not bad. 6/10 What did we want? - Hotline Miami with Russian Imageboards Memes. What have we got? - Hotline Miami with Russian Imageboards Memes with terrible graphics, gameplay, controls and storyline. Although it has the right to exist, but why do you need THIS if there are other GOOD representatives of the genre of Top-Down-Shooters and Meme games. Want more fun? - Buy Hotline Miami. Want memes to learn about Western internet culture? Buy Undertale. Our ??? Buy at worst a Bitardia. Free? Endless summer. On mobile phones ?? Same Endless Summer, Perekat, please !!! Please don't play BK. And thank God that fairness and the benefit of the number of positive reviews are decreasing. People have become smarter (I hope), and finally, they realized that they need to choose wisely, and not be led by sweet promises about memes. Bloodbath Kavkaz proved that memes are not the main thing in games. The main thing is the gameplay. P.S. At the time of the release of the game review, the Steam users' rating was 69% Now SUDDENLY has grown to 75%. Either people forgot that the game is shit, or they are stupidly joking. It seems to me that the main reason is all at once, which was stated in this script. P.P.S. (11/26/19). A miracle happened. This craft has been removed from Steam. Dagestan Technology, au revoir.

"No Man's Sky Summary: No Man's Sky is a space game for the less ambitious developed by the talented team at Hello Games (Joe Danger). Scheduled on PC and PS4, this title promises an unprecedented freedom to explore where players can explore any planet, any heaven, or any star he saw in the distance. Exhilarating! The game resolutely turned towards the genre of science fiction, will combine phases of exploration, harvesting phases and phases of combat, always with a view to survive his avatar in a futuristic environment and necessarily hostile to the neophyte who will face a wildlife and inhospitable land. His world will take place in a vast world, stripped of its limitations, since all that will appear will be accessible to the smallest of nebulae in the remotest star, not to mention the countless planets or flake the Galaxy. These will provide you with their terrestrial or underwater world to satisfy your whims seasoned explorer. They also offer the abundance of resources to enable you to progress in your galactic expeditions strengthening the body of your ship and your character. The cosmos will be randomly generated, so as to constantly renew the gaming experience with each change of sessions or server migration. While it this is not an MMO itself (players can not directly interact with each other), the Community dimension of the game will not be left behind as you may decide to work in the interest of all (including by sharing information about the explorations you have done) or not. Thus, the negative impact, as the entire extinction of an animal species in the game will be considered and will impact directly your universe. My opinion : Already a good 60 euro for a game that absolutely do not like is his promise remains a big disappointment.

"Long Review ahead. TL/DR: If you are a solo player, Apex Legends will punish you hard while also giving you no opportunity for meaningful improvement. Server issues, terrible matchmaking and numerous audio issues make playing the game a pain despite the fun and fluid foundation in its movement and gameplay. If you have two other people to play with, matchmaking is slightly more tame and the game as a whole becomes more fun, so if you can look past the rest of the issues, feel free to give it a go; but I personally would still recommend against it. Dont mind my play time - I only downloaded the game so I could leave this review, but I have played since launch until two months ago and accrued several hundred hours. Would a game simply consist of gameplay, then Apex would be the best Battle Royale there is - Respawn nailed the movement and general gameplay. Weapons sound great, walking around and lunging over obstacles/climbing up walls is fun and makes fights fluid and unpredictable. Every character is well designed, with maybe one or two small exceptions, and the game itself is relatively bug free. However, a game does not only consist of gameplay, especially not an always-online BR. The game has numerous issues, many of which have been in the game since launch and will likely never be fixed, or are even intended. Those issues bog the game down a lot and ultimately create an unfun, janky and even slightly predatory mess. First of all are the server issues. The game has 20 HZ servers, which is terrible for an active online shooter with fast movement. You will constantly get hit shortly after ducking behind walls, will miss shots that clearly hit or survive a situation that should have been fatal. It is a very inconsistent experience all around. The servers also lag very frequently and packet loss is an almost daily occurance. Second are the audio issues. The game had audio bugs since launch, and while Respawn claims they will slowly be fixed starting this season, I am skeptical. Since launch footsteps and sounds of enemy teams either dont play at all or are extremely muffled, while you can often hear your team across the map; no exaggeration. It is entirely possible to run up to a guy and shoot him in the back, all without him noticing because the sounds just dont play. This is not a headphone issue, it is a general problem. Not only that, the in game voice chat has terrible quality and everyone using it sounds like a robot or like they shoved the microphone into their mouth. The ingame store deserves a quick negative mention as well. All skins and charms are very overpriced, and while it is all optional, paying 18 or even 20 dollars for a single skin when most of the time you will never even see your character ingame is a huge ripoff. The game has loot boxes as well, but the more you level up, the less frequent they get and then eventually they stop entirely; so you are forced to pay even more if you want character items or be happy with the few meager boxes of the battle pass. It has EA written all over it. Speaking of the battle pass, it is okay. I have seen worse. Every season has its own battle pass with a few legendary skins, a reactive weapon skin that changes the more kills you get and lots of filler content like loading screens or voice lines. The reactive skins are actually pretty awesome. All of these, well, ""issues"" range from ""not that big of a problem"", like the store, to ""well, it could be annoying and should be fixed"", like the audio issues. However, it all pales to the real reason why Apex Legends is just not fun and why I wanted to write this essay of a review in the first place: the horrible matchmaking. Sure, it is a squad-based BR and as in any online game where teams fight against each other, solo players will naturally be at a disadvantage against premades, and subject to the mercy of the matchmaking. It is a tale as old as time; or, well, as old as the first multiplayer game with random matchmaking. However, Apex Legends goes a step further and employs what EA calls ""EOMM"", or ""Engagement Optimized Match Making"". Now keep in mind there is no ""real"" proof of that; the only time the developers ever really acknowledged the matchmaking, they said it employs a skill-based system, or ""SBMM"". That could not be further from the truth, or if it is, it is definitely not working. In fact, it does quite the opposite. The reason why many players believe it uses ""EOMM"" is because it seemingly measures your performance in a match and then applies it to the next match, making it either easier if you struggled, or harder if you had an easy time. Now, this does not sound TOO bad. In fact, it could be interesting if done the right way. The problem is that, whatever matchmaking system this game actually uses, it is not working and punishes you as a solo player. For some godforsaken reason, after the first initial hours pass and the system got to know you, you will constantly be matched with people with worse stats against people that have much higher stats and are diamond/master or even Apex Predator, the highest rank in the game, even in casual matches. There is nothing worse that being matched up against people who played the game for 2000 hours and have 10000 kills on a single character while you played for 40 hours and have a KD of 1. Yet this is what happens in Apex; over and over and over. You will be matched against premade Master or AP players while you have a few hundred kills and squadmates who cant find the front of their gun. I am not even blaming my squadmates in this case; I didnt want to be here either, but the MM brought us all here. I wanted to be matched with and against people of my average skill - but this NEVER happens in Apex, ever. And after we die either instantly or after 20 minutes of looting in the first fight, the fun begins again. I am really not a great player; all I ask for is fairness. After 12 or 13 of those games, the system then seems to recognize  that you are having a hard time and gives you 1 or 2 easy games. But since you will have higher stats in those games, it will immediately ""demote"" you again and match you against  the sweatiest tryhards known to man. You may see the problem. It is not something that I, as a solo player, could circumvent. It is also not something I could skirt around by ""gitting gud"", as the game gives me no opportunity to. I cant outplay Predator squads, and neither can my teammates. This is also not a solitary experience; there are many complaints exactly like mine. It is a very predictable pattern once you have seen it a few times. And after having that exact pattern a dozen times, I decided to quit about two months ago.  It is simply not fun to die directly after you land or whenever the first fight happens, every single game, with nothing you can do, even after months of playing. It should also be mentioned that these matchmaking issues did not start until Season 3; before that matchmaking seemed to be just fine and I had a great time. With good and consistent skill-based MM, this game could be truly amazing. So this is where we are at. A fantastic BR at its core, but with a too expensive store, terrible and outdated servers, audio issues and the worst matchmaking I have ever experienced in 20 years of gaming. If you still want to try it out, go ahead - it is free and the first few levels are a sort of grace period where you will be teamed with higher-leveled people on purpose to see all the shiny skins and cool tricks.  But, unless you are absolutely terrible at FPS games or a god who destroys everything anyway, you will probably not have a good time after a while - and it is a shame because Apex had SUCH high potential.  If the matchmaking ever gets fixed, it could reach that potential. Until then, I would advise to stay far away as every season the game seems to deteriorate just slightly. I hope it will improve eventually, as the game deserves it for sure.",False,False

"The game is 6 months old and even still it's experiencing constant crashing with the latest Nvidia drivers, rolling the driver back to version 373.06 seems to fix crashing but the game is poorly optomised if it isn't able to handle the latest drivers for Nvidia cards. It's a shame because the game isn't a bad one at all, especially if you're a fan of the manga/anime but I think it's highly important that if you're going to charge consumers £50 for a game then it shouldn't be shot to hell and at least be updated on occasion to prevent this kind of thing from happening! I can't believe in 2017 developers just expect the consumers to work out fixes for themselves whilst shafing us for extortion prices for their under developed games! 5/10 ",False,False
"With the fourth DLC ""Psychological War and the fantastic Fustercluck"", Season Pass 1 for Borderlands 3 will be completed and the maximum level increased to 65. The expectations are high, after all, it is WAR that we are talking about here. The completely crazy psycho, a mass murdered individual who rides the ""Pooptrain"", wants to tell us his tragic story. We experience a somewhat insane story, with some great conversations but unfortunately also extreme weaknesses in game design. This DLC is played with our previous positive memories with War from Borderlands 2. We meet some characters we have come to love, like Krieg. We get insights into the extended story of the universe of war, which is divided by three mission sections + final boss. This is rounded off by often funny but also sick conversations. In terms of the story, we move through the destroyed psyche of war. This invites us in his schizophrenic manner and every now and then provides some funny moments. The surroundings are mostly varied and above all abstract, equally creative but always monotonous without end. There would have been significant upward potential here. So far, basically good approaches for a final story DLC. The side missions, on the other hand, are hard to beat in terms of lack of imagination - no moment is required. Either the side missions are solved directly on site, or you have to revisit the different level sections - that's really annoying. Anyone who knows the then funny and now cult side mission from Borderlands 2 in Thousand Cuts, by Face McShooty with ""Shoot me in the face"", knows how much time it takes and how demanding it is. The opponent's diversity is successful, but you already know it enough. To solve the side missions, you can fight your way through the already explored area again, because the side mission is at the end of the respective area. The last task takes place in ""Kammerhalla"", visually reminiscent of the levels from Doom, which are decorated with guts and blood. The fight itself is similar to the boss fights in Painkiller or Doom. The gigantic final battle is impressive in the short term, simply because of the size of the final boss. Nevertheless, depending on the chosen level of difficulty, this fight degenerates into pure work. We literally have to empty magazine after magazine for minutes - the life bar of the final boss, however, only decreased marginally! Not cool - the loot was also disappointing. The only real innovation that you get without the DLC is the increase of the maximum level to 65. The opponent design is not particularly new or creative, but includes known opponents. There are a few new weapons, new skins for each of the four player characters and new challenges. The latter are to be achieved by completing the story and are not particularly difficult. The conclusion of Season Pass 1 of Borderlands 3 around the character war offers so many steep templates for the developers, which nevertheless remained largely unused. Some of the conversations with war stay in our minds, others we have already forgotten because of their irrelevance. Many areas are too spacious and not varied enough. The DLC is aimed primarily at fans of war, but even these will have their problems enjoying the DLC to the full. 5/10 points ",False,False

"At first, the game seemed interesting, different tasks, its own large workshop and a variety of components. But my opinion after 8 hours in my career began to change. I made the final decision after playing 20 hours with the purchase of dlc ""Esports Expansion"". I did not notice many advantages, except for expectations at the very beginning) So, from the pros: - For those who dreamed of a powerful top-end PC but the dream did not come true, now this can be done in the virtual world of PC Building Simulator and rejoice) - The presence of different components, from top-end to old ones. - Old cheap computers and components enliven the game and create some kind of variety - Beautiful, top-end components with different rgb bulbs and housings, you can see how it all looked in real life if you bought it in reality. - I was able to assemble my own computer with almost all the components, except for the cooling of the cpu and sdd, it made me happy) - There are all sorts of things to facilitate assembly. - Relaxing light music. Now the cons: - The absence of many well-known leading companies on the PC market in my experience is Noctua, Western Digital, Samsung - Even old assemblies have top-end components of their time, although in reality not everything is so good in life. - Strong difference in characteristics of video cards of old models from real ones (maybe there is something else) - Inadequate 3dmark test results and long delay. - Lack of prompts in the game, even at the beginning of my career, or I had to somehow turn them on myself ... - Automatic connection of wires does not work correctly, which is why I have to remove all the fans and connect them manually. - And most importantly, why this game is a failure. The bugs in the game are terrible, like the tasks, they are a match for each other) Absolutely ridiculous and monotonous tasks in a career. Absolutely stupid sometimes even meaningless text of the task itself in the mail. For example, a task to install two video cards or replace something to increase the 3dmark score with a budget of $ 600. The initial score can be 4000-6000 and you need 11000-13000 from experience in the game, I was convinced that it is unrealistic to do this with such a budget, maximum you will raise the score by 2000 points. Diagnose and replace broken parts. There is a bug in the game that after disassembling the entire computer and replacing everything that is broken, you do not get the checkbox ""perform diagnostics"" and therefore do not complete the task and in dlc ""Esports Expansion"" you cannot end the day and play further)) In the end, the absurdity of a career finished off when played ""Esports Expansion"" you fix the team's computers and they break them every new day a week before the game. They kick, throw them from the balcony, throw them at people, leave them at the doors of other people's apartments, and a thousand more of the same reasons, and every day these people come to mind to change something in their computer besides the main task in the mail to fix the broken computer with their own legs, they start writing dozens of messages with some kind of requests or even worse the next day when everything is repaired this is the whole point of dlc. Hmm)) Of course I can be wrong somewhere, I don't work as a computer technician, I just studied all this when I was working on my computers) Nevertheless, the game does not bring any pleasure except laughter and sometimes it starts to annoy (bugs, tasks, waste of time on the same place) so I will not recommend the game and will most likely delete it for the near future for sure :( ",False,False

Musica - 2 - It's the same thing as mineirinho's ""trilogy"" (or developer games). - Songs taken from some singer who will give you Copyright if you are going to make a video or live (The band's name is The Jolly Rogers) - And the songs keep repeating themselves all the time. - The gunshot sound is clearly taken from a website that can pick up sounds and not take action afterwards. - The lines of the characters are the same, just some new lines because of the new items. Physics - 1 - The only thing that physics is good is water because the rest, meo deos. - In the 3rd phase of the game, if you know how the physics work and etc ... Say goodbye to him, because you will see the terrible things in that phase. Is there history? - Eh, there is no story of the game for what I saw, if I see a ""story"" in the game, I edit that part. The game is ""good"" the only thing that makes everything monotonous is the camera. The sounds sucks, the credits ..

"It is difficult to spoil Tetris, but Sega has succeeded. The focus of the game is on battles against other players. There is even an adventure mode for a player, but even in this mode the focus is on beating opponents controlled by the computer. The Endless mode of the original Tetris is half hidden, within the Marathon option, which is unnecessarily confusing. In addition, Endless mode has a speed limit; to level 15, which is still easy enough to keep playing and playing. It doesn't even come close to having the level of challenge that the NES Tetris had. Oh, and there's Puyo Puyo too. It ends up being a nice bonus, and the Fusion mode that mixes Tetris and Puyo Puyo has its qualities, but it's not worth buying the game just for that. The worst part is the online Versus mode. Sega simply thought it was a good alternative to let people play freely online without having the option to filter the level of the players. So your first game could be against an experienced person right away and you wouldn't stand a chance of winning. That, of course, if you find someone to play against. It's not that hard to find someone to play against you in Puzzle League mode, but good luck finding someone to play in Free Play mode. There are several better versions of Tetris, and free, to top it off. You can even have fun trying to achieve the achievements, and the adventure mode serves to spend time for a few hours, but in general I do not recommend the game.

"This is a classic example of a game that lures you in with the setting, vidos and praise from paid reviewers, but in fact is just a burp and spit in the face from the developers. I would understand if this game was in Early Access and certainly not for 700 rubles. About the price is generally a separate conversation. What kind of shisha is she worth so much for? Is Vostok games really not enough money that hateful schoolchildren pour into donations in this pathetic Survarium? Besides, I don’t understand, wasn’t it possible to add this ""Battle escape"" (I cannot even name this mode for Battle Royale) in free Survarium, in which the setting is essentially the same (example: Warface)?

The map looks unnecessarily huge and the filling itself with objects is monotonous. Dogs move supernaturally and sometimes go through walls. The system of red zones itself is made rash and appears on the map in one second. And in addition to everything, the exclusion zone itself poses practically no danger to the player. The only advantage of this game is the idea of ​​the game itself, and the fact that you are constantly on the move, in a hurry getting to the helicopter.

Dedazen to taki ""pro"" gracz że w S&D chce grać bez granatów dymnych i flashbangów które łącznie z podstawowym granatem (który nie zadaje 100% obrażeń) są w tej grze jedynie czasowe więc cały czas dzień w dzień nawet jak nie gracie odbierają wam pieniądze.  To pierwszy ale nie jedyny element p2w który w tej pseudo grze zobaczycie.

A może będzie to pół roku. Pół roku będziecie grać dla jakiegoś marnego 1000 medali a broń kosztuje 2500 a nowe mogą kosztować i po 5000 czy 10 000. Bo dlaczego nie?  I teraz dochodzimy do najważniejszego skrzynek ze skórkami. Gdzie tutaj p2w? A co znajduje się w skrzynkach oprócz skórek? Złoto i medale. O to właśnie chodzi. Jeb. te skórki, kogo one obchodzą? Skoro da się kupić i złoto i medale to mamy do czynienia z nieuczciwą przewagą bo zdobycie tych walut nie wymaga od osoby płacącej grania.  I teraz jest tak: kupujecie sobie 100 skrzyneczek, z nich dostaniecie powiedzmy 8000 medali, kupujecie SR-47 i z każdym dniem jesteście coraz lepsi poprzez ogranie danej broni. Osoba która nie płaci będzie grindować wuj wie ile i jak w końcu kupi SR-47 to w patchu dojdzie AK-12 który miażdży SR-47 i kosztuje wspomniane 5000 medali. I co wtedy? 100 dolarów i mam AK12. A ty, bez 100 dolarów? A grinduj kolejne pół roku. Tyle że za pół roku sytuacja się powtórzy dojdzie nowa broń, a AK12 się znerfi jak będzie taka potrzeba. I co, będziecie buczeć że tak się nie robi?

Totalne nieporozumienie. Headshot to jest headshot, natychmiastowa eliminacja i nagroda za to że celujecie. W Black Squad najlepszą techniką wygrywania jest strzelba albo full auto z smg bo i tak liczą tylko obrażenia na pocisk które trafiły przeciwnika. Najlepiej byłoby całkowicie wywalić iron sight bo i tak nic nie daje. Spray and pray sprawdza się w 100%. I nawet nie patrzcie na statystyki broni. Ponieważ jak napisałem liczy się tylko i wyłącznie rof to bronie takie jak Type mimo że mają najwyższe obrażenia na pocisk są i tak wuja warte bo mają tak kolosalny odrzut że po pierwszym pocisku drugi leci gdzie mu pasuje. Wydawca gry miał to zmienić po tym jak gracze wersji koreańskiej pokazali im dowód że tam takiego odrzutu nie ma. Mieli ale nie zrobili, a napisali że zrobili. W CBT przetestowałem wszystkie bronie a w nagrodę za udział każdy dostał Type. I jak strzela Type? Tak samo - w niebo. Lepiej kupić MSR bo jest bronią bardzo lekką jak na snajpę, zabija na jedno trafienie a dodatkowo ma błyskawiczny pojedynczy zoom. Można by ją wręcz nazwać ""snajperką szturmową"". Kto grał w BF ten wie o co chodzi. Oszuści, oszuści czyli nasz ulubiony temat ww wszystkich ""darmowych"" gracz. Oszuści oczywiście już są. Gra ma już swoje lata więc wallhack czy aimbot równie długo były dostępne a na oszustwie zarabia się dzisiaj spore pieniądze. Praktycznie każdy anticheat został zbajpasowany więc czy to wersja koreańska, europejska czy mongolska nie ma to znaczenia. I nawet w S&D gdzie ten co zginął może obserwować twoją grę z twoich oczu się z tym nie kryją. Trzy drogi do celu, wciśnięty shift przyklejony do klawiatury, tłumik na lufie. I co? I dostajecie w banie jak tylko wyjdziecie zza rogu. Kilka razy dałem się celowo zabić żeby obejrzeć grę jednego typka. Czy było to ogarnięcie? W żadnym wypadku. Znał pozycję wszystkich przeciwników i tylko czekał aż podejdą. Tak więc sami widzicie. Gra ma 4 dni i już jest po niej. Co będzie jak zdobędzie popularność czyli tysiące Rosjan i Turków. Szkoda w ogóle marnować czas. Reasumując jak macie w miarę kompa to kupcie sobie BF4 czy BF1 jak wam pasuje IWŚ, a jak macie peceta na węgiel i brak gotówki to Black Opsa 2 za 20 zł. Lepiej na tym wyjdziecie a o wszelkich ""darmowych"" grach zapomnijcie na zawsze. Aktualizacja nr 1. Grę oficjalnie można już uznać za martwą. Została właśnie nawiedzona przez grupę reklamującą cheaty za parę euro więc zaraz każdy szwabik będzie biegał odpalony. Aby uświadomić wam w jakim stopniu gra została złamana dodam tylko że kolesie potrafią sobie  nawet w dowolnej chwili zmienić nick czyli CheatEngine hulaj dusza piekła nie ma. Nie mówimy już nawet o wallhacku czy aimbocie. Typek miał nielimitowaną ilość amunicji, brak przeładowania broni i widział lecące w jego stronę granaty. Ale wuj z tym, więcej skórek, dajcie więcej skórek. Aktualizacja nr 2. Zaczyna się typowe ukrywanie problemu poprzez zamykanie niewygodnych tematów i pseudo pier. o tym jak to BattlEye zostanie zaktualizowany. Kiedy? Tego oczywiście nikt nie wie. Zresztą nie ma to żadnego znaczenia w momencie kiedy 24 godziny po nim ukaże się nowy bajpas. ToRRent się ciężko udziela ale każdy go zlewa bo widzi co się dzieje. Serwer EU świeci pustkami. Demolition czy Assassination czekam minutę i gra się nie rozpoczyna. W Battle Match to już w ogóle nikt nie chce grać skoro w pierwszej sekundzie oszust ustawia wynik meczu.

"The little black box came... I almost fell asleep in the middle of the night, bought it and played for half an hour. For the time being, I feel that Ren also wrote the script using Shiba-senpai’s narrative method. The dubbing is Megumi, and the illustration is Yinglili... Uh... the rest will be added until the post is finished. The producer’s attitude is very moved, but passion is not the only one Ah, Ren Jialun also makes games. At any rate, he is also a well-known up master. He knows that he will give praise first, and look forward to doing better. -------------------------------------------------- ---------- After pushing the update, it is not recommended. To be honest, I really want to recommend it, but personally, it is a consumer consumer first. From the player's point of view, the experience that this game brings to me does not match the price, so I do not recommend it. For a visual novel game, the most important thing is the script. From the overall development situation, the funding of the development team is very tight. Art, music, programs, script length, etc. are all subject to funding issues. The first choice for saving money is undoubtedly to reduce the length of the script, which also leads to a decline in the overall game experience. I was thinking about halfway through the game, if I wanted to describe this game in one sentence, it would be ""Dreamback to 2011"". It's not that the ""WA2CC"" that was released in 2011 is a gal, it's because in 2011 I started to read a lot of fantasy novels. It's a bit ashamed to say that my youth novel enlightenment is from Guo Jingming and Han Han's generation. At that time, the most popular culture of the primary four produced a Western fantasy novella series called ""Oathtaking"", each with a knight story about 200,000 words. (There is one thing to say. At that time, I still thought that several of them were pretty good-looking, such as ""Dragon Knight's Thousand Year Oath"", although the plot was completely forgotten...) At that time, after reading a book, I was thinking about 200,000 words to describe one. The vivid and concrete fantasy world, the narration of love and hate operas that span time and space, the creation of flesh and blood characters (girls), and the main point of the story. The difficulty is like shaping a waterless sand. It is too difficult. The number of words is really too much. Difficult. This feeling is especially worse after reading the song of ice and fire and profanity. The script of ""The Ring of Mobius"", as expected, was as sandy as it was, and collapsed. Because of the limited length of the script and the lack of details, the paper man is a paper man after all. Under the hatred of the country and the family, only one character label can be seen for each character; lack of paving, emotions come too fast like a tornado; lack of echo, games The POV technique used by Ice and Fire is indeed commendable, but unfortunately it does not show the subtlety of this technique-describing the same event from a multi-character perspective, so that readers can suddenly realize that the case is amazing (for example, it may not be appropriate) To add an example, the effect is similar to that of the second music room Dongma stealing a kiss from Chunxi in WA2. The perspective of IC Chunxi is accompanied by the perspective of Coda Dongma from the novel Xuecai perspective, which constitutes the climax of IC and Coda. From the result of the game, the essence of the game is still a straightforward narrative from the perspective of God. This is the pot of the plot. There is no use of POV techniques, just convenient for narration. In addition, the lack of combat plots, climax arrangements and other issues have the cost of art, but the main thing is the script. Every time the battle is over in a flash, the wedding that I have been waiting for for a long time has nothing to do...just? This? ? ? This is the end of the battle with the last few PPTs of the battle for 20 minutes, or the last few PPTs of the four books written with a million words, and the end of the fight is not good enough to get together, and nothing happened. City "") What is the difference? Because these deficiencies cause the plot to be strange, I won't repeat it. The sand is normal, broken, and silent. For a visual novel game, the most important thing is the script. If the funds are limited, it will be even more necessary to spend on the script to increase the repetition rate of the paintings, increase the plot, and the dialogue. Are there many original backgrounds and vertical paintings of those gods? Not much. If the number of words is really limited, please don't challenge fantasy themes, please screenwriters do what they can. Let's talk about other feelings: Artist: As the signature of this work, it really allows players to see the industry's leading art level, and the original paintings are really amazing (all are white flowers~). But Live2D doesn't really understand the meaning to be honest, oh I heard that it is required for crowdfunding, that's fine. As for the expressions of the characters, except for Wei Er's extremely embarrassing Tsundere, the other girls are Ling Poli. Well, I like Li, I think just smile. Let me mention two more bugs with inconsistent texts. One is that Cantis has ""crimson"" hair but pink hair in the painting; the other is why there are so many large diamonds on the shelf in the background when Weia talks with her dad? If the country is rich, can I see a wall of Gundam? Music: Not bad, not too outrageous, and not particularly stunning. Dubbing: As mentioned at the beginning of this article, the dubbing looks like Megumi Kato. One is the textual issue, the spoken language is too written, it is really difficult for the voice actors to make the character say ""compared to this"" in a serious way. Another problem may be personal habits. The ACG category cannot accept dubbing in languages ​​other than Japanese. Considering funding and effects, I prefer full-text and no-voice games. ""Mirage House"" also proved that if the music is good enough, no dubbing is not a problem at all. In addition, I would like to comment on whether a voice character can pinch the voice together when it cuts to the next non-voice character. When you turn back several pages, many long sentences are still being read, which affects the reading experience. Procedure: The previous reviews mentioned windowing and scrolling page issues, so I won’t go into details. In the late game, about 4-3, and in Chapter 5, there were many BUGs that showed blank pages in the history. In these two chapters, there are many wrong quotation marks in the dialogue or the use of English quotation marks. It seems that there are typos. I really doubt whether it has been tested in actual play, or just checked the text in the program (although the programming dog can understand it well and cannot see the quotation marks). In general, given the play experience and actual price, I decided not to recommend it. It may be that I have been in contact with works in recent years because I criticized the space scores for playing in order from top to bottom, which is too demanding, but it is true that the experience brought by this work is too flat. Obviously, it is the funding problem that causes this problem. I can understand the helplessness of the production team. It is difficult to avoid the lack of funding and the distribution of the first film. But at least I can see the sincerity, at least I can dream back to 2011... So for the consumers who see here, since they have the patience to see here, I still feel that I should support the development team, even if it is not financial mentally. At least this work is barely in the forefront of domestic gals in terms of quality~ Above PS: I didn't save the last paragraph before writing, and I clicked on the right to allow me to leave a message. All are rewritten, gtmdsteam. Damn, why should I write so much? ",False,False

Also, not always intelligible dialogues, one actor says one thing, and the other answers him in a wrong way. Not what you expect. Perhaps due to the presence of a choice of answers and different directions of the dialogues, at the ""junctions"" the scriptwriters did not quite manage to combine them harmoniously.

"This is SHOCK! I played Dota all stars since 2003, then switched to DOTA 2 in 2012 ... everything was fine for the first 3 years until 2015 ... then it became clear that the game was drowned and money was sucked out of people by events and dota pass, adjusting the imbalance to the character on which has a top gear in this dota pass, ..

"This is a borderline negative review as I enjoyed most of the game, the story line and the artwork but also found it frustrating.  I had problems with some of the game mechanics that ultimately meant if felt unsatisfying - and in a match-3 game where creating matches and clearing tiles is supposed to be satisfying - that is a serious problem.  The game was a little insensitive to the mouse, there were several times I was swiping right to left and it animated a down swap and on the left hand side of the board occasionally swapping tiles inadvertently triggered one of the special effects.  I also found it irritating to match 5 tiles (creating a special star) as this didn't effect the gold tile borders underneath (removed by matching 3 or 4 tiles) or using the 'clear all tiles of one kind' as this again didn't effect the borders.  Half of the special effects seemed useless in furthering gameplay.  I also found some of the tile types difficult to distinguish between (especially when covered in chains) due to similar shapes and colours eg. blue circles/blue bottles, apples/pumpkins.  In a few of the larger puzzles I was unable to see the top corner tiles due to the header band covering them so it was guess work to match and clear them.  By about 3/4 of the way through the game these frustrations led to it feeling really grindy instead of a fun casual game - so I have to give it a negative review. ",False,False

"Unfortunately like Agony, very, very boring. You slaughter yourself with a few weapons that are visually close to each other by some opponents who have bone weapons and armor.

In my opinion, the developers spent more time creating achievements (and there are as many as 5863 here) than creating the game itself. If earlier, this kind of ""game"" was made and bought for the sake of cards, now, for 29 rubles. you get a thick bundle of achievements, but not the game itself.

"Update: Four new dlcs are cut into one, the comrades dlc is suspended, and the level editor is cancelled. I'm going to your mother's idiot SE ------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ------------------- 400 hours = 300 hours a week of this article (collection of all branches, all dishes, all fishing confiscated) + 100 hours of a week of comrades (physical number, Four 120-level extreme weapons have been trained, and they have passed Sword God 3 and Yan God 2) So I deleted the old evaluation to send a complete evaluation, which is very long. I have to sum it up: this game has mixed reviews. The advantages include an interesting battle system, rich collection elements, complex mazes and beautiful music. The shortcomings are the plot after rushing to work and the side tasks that the process is too simple. The comrades-in-arms DLC must play, and the three gay DLC must play. Before the release, it can be seen that SE is sincere and confident, and it is also a running tool and a playable demo. . . I personally feel that the actual effect is not bad. Most of my (local tyrant) friends can run this game smoothly. The 960m 4G memory version that I use, i5 4210H, 8G memory, 900P resolution, 75% resolution and low image quality. 50FPS in the maze, 40FPS on the Lucis map, around 30 in battle. Water capital 28FPS, 30FPS in the city of Restorm 25. Strong DLC ​​big scene 30FPS indoor 40, yellow hair DLC40FPS indoor 50, Yima DLC40FPS, comrades DLC40FPS, it can be said to be satisfactory. The combat system is mainly to operate Prince Noctis, using his ""displacement ability"" (throw a weapon, and then the whole person teleports over with the weapon) flexibly attack and dodge, and make use of the command skills of the base friends (covering Three functional modules of RPG: auxiliary, milk and output). After learning the skill ""Unlimited Skywalking"", when using one-handed swords and spears, you can use one-handed swords and spears to attack enemies in the air without limit. After clearing the dungeon maze, you can get a super jewelry that allows the prince to automatically dodge enemy attacks. After collecting 13 Phantom Swords, you can get the accessory ""Proof of the True King"" and turn on the True Phantom Sword mode. Compared with the ordinary Phantom Sword Summoning, the true Phantom Sword mode has a much longer duration, greatly increased attacks, and a successful defense. Filling the phantom slot, there are 4 brand-new command skills and 4 combo skills in the real phantom sword mode, it is very pleasant to abuse the boss. By the 13th chapter, you can also get the weapon ""Ring of Radiance"" that kills mobs in seconds and restores HP significantly. In addition, after learning the skills of manipulating teammates, you will be able to manipulate basemates in battle. Guladiosi uses a large sword and shield to increase the attack rate by defense. Ignis has three types of knives. The Fire Knife is a quick attack against a single enemy, the Thunder Knife is a fast teleport attack, and the Ice Knife is a wide range attack. The higher the number of combos, the higher the attack rate. In addition, the magic eye can be used not only Activating powerful skills, using the magic eye when dying can quickly resurrect. Prompt’s gameplay is third-person shooting. He can use pistols, submachine guns, bazookas and grenades. After completing the exclusive branch of the three teammates in Chapter 14, you will get accessories that strengthen their operation mode. Among them, Prompt's accessories can increase his critical strike rate and turn the submachine gun into unlimited ammunition. In general, in addition to the pain of the angle of view, the fighting is cool, it looks cooler, and the performance is very good. I personally feel that the most exciting battle is the first time the Imperial Base has played against Longqi. The magic system of this work can see the shadow of ""FF7 Core Crisis"" by Tabatata's early works, all of which involve the participation of props. After collecting the elements in the elemental rock, the prince can refine it together with the recovery props or food materials or enemy drops. Various effects can be obtained after refining. Some can increase the number of magic combos, some can restore HP and the upper limit of HP, some can gain a lot of experience after use, and some can break the upper limit of magic damage to 99999. Using magical flowers in the game can greatly reduce the difficulty. The labyrinth in this game is more complicated, it will be around regardless of the strategy, and the length is long enough (yes, it is you, the Witcher 3 Fallout 4, your labyrinth is too short), it is absolutely worthy of SE's years of RPG development experience. After clearing the level, there will be a highly difficult hidden maze. The hidden maze monster has a high level, but relatively, except for one or two fork roads, it is basically a road. But it's not without shortcomings. Noctis's displacement ability is very fun, but in the end, there is no maze that uses this ability? ? ? Only three military bases can infiltrate and assassinate with displacement capabilities. The number of weapons and equipment in this article is pretty good, and each weapon has unique special effects (although the main weapon of Noctis is the official cheater blessing sword) and exquisite appearance, using the phantom sword to attack the enemy will consume physical strength, so the general phantom The sword is used to support the attributes. After clearing the level, you can play legendary weapon series missions and hidden mazes to get the strongest weapon. Powerful bosses such as Omega, Golden Tortoise, and Level 99 Imperial Mecha Angels will drop powerful trinkets, and certain branches and hunting missions will also give powerful trinkets after playing. Ignis’s cooking is a collection of more than 100 kinds, even if it is driven in low quality, the cooking is still exquisite to the level of fake and real (don’t play in the middle of the night). And the cooking of BOSS ingredients in the later stage will greatly enhance combat effectiveness. It is recommended that you finish the branch line in the Restorm market as soon as possible. There is a shop that specializes in selling BOSS ingredients. To complete his branch line tasks, the boss will give you a big discount! There is also fishing that even the official Twitter account has to be hacked. Here are the methods for obtaining the three strongest fishing gear. The strongest fishing rod: complete the side task of the fishing master. The strongest take-up device: Obtained by Water Capital Colosseum. The strongest bait: Camping in Wester Lake triggers the main branch of the fishing lake, obtained after success. But even with the three strongest fishing gear, encountering big boss-level fish like the Pink Devil Gar is still quite troublesome. After talking about cooking and fishing, I have to mention the ""another god of water"" on the Shuidu branch. After arriving at the designated location and watching the whale, you can catch black tuna. Using its meat, you can make the strongest black tuna sushi. Yes: Noctis loves to eat, so the command slot filling efficiency is improved; all attributes are strengthened; endurance is unlimited; crit rate is 100%. The Water God incident can be triggered once a day, each time with two black tuna and three pieces of meat each time. Please catch it as much as possible. The black tuna sushi is combined with the real phantom sword, and Omega will call you all! In addition, there are two modifications of Regalia, a lot of stickers and paintings, and a lot of parts to collect. After the eighth chapter, it can be converted into an off-road vehicle full of maps, and after clearing the customs, it can be converted into a speeding car. The highest prize of the Shuidu Arena is the magic engine. With it, you don't need to refuel. . . In addition, the final fantasy music and Neal’s mechanical era albums can be bought in the game, and then played while driving or exploring. (Only without FFXV's own, it's very annoying) In terms of side quests, I feel that the side and side quests are simply staying at the level of the 2D game era. Go to the place to fight a monster, send the thing back, experience and get the money, except for some quest rewards Apart from being satisfactory, it is as plain as water. It may be the first open world of the FF series and the first action role-playing. There will always be some immature places. The highlight of the four DLCs is closely related to the CG movie ""Sword of the King"" in plot. I suggest you make up the movie and play this again. The comrade-in-arms is not an open world, but a way to pick up a copy of the task, and at the same time collect the circuit diagram of the gods. The equipment system is better than this article, and even allows me to regain the thrill of the old man 5 when I brushed the three gods, carefully plan the use of every resource, and seize the time to make good use of the forging buff. Behind each extreme weapon is a carefully calculated material usage and a ""liver"" process of brushing materials. The action system is also better. The ""slashing"" system as a finishing move is carried forward in the dlc, but the even moves and finishing moves in this article are not clearly stated. It depends on the player to explore, and the spear-like attack action even has its own displacement ability. Up. The comrades-in-arms do not have the Phantom Sword. Instead, they are replaced by the ""King's Protection"" of the 13 ancestors of Lucis, which can be seen as an enhanced version of the various skills in this article or the Phantom Sword (a permanent BUFF that can be equipped on the body). The final effect can be seen in the screenshot below, with 100% resistance, immunity to all abnormal conditions, and 2000+ attack and defense. . . For comrades-in-arms gameplay, please refer to this post. In addition, comrades-in-arms have some other advantages, such as being able to pinch their faces, playing the role of Elis, Dragon Knight, brother-in-law Rebs, King Daddy Regis and others. There are also mini games such as Chocobo Colosseum Mine. After noon, there are basically people who can swipe the limited-time tasks, but it is not easy to find people for other tasks, probably because the online experience is very poor, but fortunately, comrades can swipe them alone. In short, it is quite fun as a copy of DLC, but it is not so good as an online content, and the online experience is very poor. These dlcs are really fun. It is recommended to fight one by one according to the sequence of the plot, without waiting for the clearance. The scene in Gula Dios is good, a bit of a dark soul, and even the gameplay is blind dick roll + shield reverse. (Guratius comes with unlimited endurance) teammate is the undead general Cole. In this article, Gu Ladiosi can play this after leaving the team. The Plumput chapter has a small open world, full gun battle, and you can sneak a little in the facility at the beginning. The teammate is Sister Longqi. In this article, Prompt leaves the team. The Ignis chapter is the best. Although the water is open, the map is smaller but larger than the Plumput chapter. There are more things in the map. The hook and claws are very refreshing and the IF line is added for a perfect ending. You can play this after the story of the city of Water. The IF line ending is recommended to play after clearing the customs. After these three dlcs are played or certain conditions are met, new weapons, new costumes and new skills will be added to the main line. The quality and rewards are good. After the dlc is cleared, there will be additional difficult battles, friends who love suffering and have confidence in their own level can try it. This time, the PC version corresponds to the console royal version, and all the DLC has been released, so there is an official cheat device in the opening backpack that ""charges you to become stronger"". As a result, the initial difficulty of the game is very low. In the spring of 2018, the first version of the mod tool will be released, which can make task skins and new weapons. More functions will be added in the future, including level editor, operation of other creatures, etc. (the B station has a demo video). In the summer of 2018, comrades will have a major update and withdraw from the standalone version, and there will be a second major update of comrades in winter. Four new DLCs will be launched in 2019, the chapter of Yadan, the chapter of Luna, the chapter of Alanya and the chapter of Noctis. The quality of DLC that has been launched so far is very good, so I personally think that the follow-up content is quite worth looking forward to. Previously, foreign media reported that the transplantation of Final Fantasy 15 was not bad, but it was experimental. SE has said that after the successful transplant, the next luminous engine game will be faster and better. As for the game, it is not yet known. A few days ago, I passed the FFXV official push and learned that SE has established a new luminous studio, and the person in charge is Tian Hatta. The mobile version has become a closed game, but the music is restored well, and displacement can also be used in combat. The language comes with simplified Chinese. The first chapter is free, and the remaining chapters can be purchased as a package for a fee. It is sold at 128 in the ios area and 19 dollars in the Android Google Play area. ",False,False

"Not horror, stupidly wandering around with puzzles in dark locations.

Adrenaline - slow down the time in order to jump further or have time to slip through. Red cubes - help you climb or press a button. It seemed to me that the game was a bit like BioShock and quite a bit like Penumbra. Here you don't run away or hide from anyone, you walk stupidly and solve puzzles. You will reach the very end of the game, and you think this is all, the end, but there is no more 5 minutes of chatter by the Doctor, who explains why the GG is here and what happened to his father, and all this could be told in 1 minute.

"Quite depressive game. In a tedious way. I think this game represents both senseless actions without any true goal and hardships of life. It is quite merciless, it barely brings you anything good, it is dark and fairly cold in terms of its atmosphere. So it fits cyberpunk to no small degree.  It's as mediocre as it gets. I can barely say much about it. You just drive, and if you hit something, you explode. Nothing about this game is truly bad nor truly good. But it's a hard thing to like for sure. It is very repetitive, boring, and pretty senseless because you have very few goals.  It's not enjoyable, yet not a complete trash in terms of its quality. However, it is a boring game with very few reasons to play it, a totally skippable small game. Not something I regret buying, as it was very cheap, but I wouldn't call it a worthy purchase either. It's not even sad, or frustrating, or at least somewhat fascinating, it is one of games I feel nothing about. Which is not a good thing for sure, but neither it is an inherently bad thing.

"I actually can't understand why all the bugs and errors are not fixed ... I thought about getting the game a long time ago and have always skimmed reviews and never quite understood why so many people were talking about the bugs in a card game (with only one card game ...) - after less than nine hours it becomes clear to you: Should you ever get into an open party lobby, there is of course the risk that you will not be able to play (round does not go any further or you cannot play your cards) or the game freezed. Furthermore, I had such a loud interfering sound twice when connecting that I literally winced and that was legit unbearable>.> Then - even with an existing internet connection - there are numerous connection problems; you try to get into a lobby (which is randomly mentioned by the way; you can't choose which lobby you want to go to [except for friend invite ofc]) and get the message ""No internet connection"" - oh well, then XD everything else works yes also problem-free xd Then you restart your game AGAIN and come to a lobby in which the game has apparently already ended -> GAME FREEZE! HAMMER. Restart again: D you like that, right? ^^ Maybe it's just me but ... well I don't have such problems in any other game The period from the start of the game until you can actually do something is imo a bit long - especially again with the well-known Ubisoft message ""Don't play LONGER THAN ONE HOUR WITHOUT A PAUSE OF 15 MINUTES ""... ehm wtf, on the uplay homepage you can see the duration of your longest games - if I myself with over an hour or with a friend with almost two hours of playtime related to ONE match) should take a break after an hour ... so yeah, the message makes zero sense (even if I know that none of us hobby-free Spackos stick to it anyway xd).

"GAME, if I may say so, is not bad, but not good either. In general: this is the worst game from telltale. What we have: a seemingly good and interesting universe, in which there should be good, colorful and interesting characters, an interesting plot.

However, the longer we played the game, the more and more things disliked it. First, the game has some buggies to it. More than once we had to go through the mission anew because the characters refused to obey and lived their own lives. Otherwise, you wanted to enter the subway, it would throw you on the skyscraper.

Third, redundant animations. We appreciate the artistry of programmers, graphic designers and Mr. Grażyniki, what she made coffee, but watching Tony Stark for the nth time waiting for his armor to arrive, sneaking up to him, digging up, etc. terribly irritating.

"this game is the definition of insanity. Warning: after 300 hours in this game you will write a similar review as me down here. I am writing this text after half a year without playing Dead by Daylight. It took so long for me to return to normal mentally from this game. So ... take the text below with a grain of salt. After every match in this, I feel like going to shoot the fucking wholesaler, this game is such blatant shit that it's not even possible. As a rank 4, I'm telling you if you've been playing this for a while, you know what I'm talking about. Literal cockroach. AND IT IS COMPLETELY BEST WHEN YOUR WIFI IS AS GREAT AS GREAT AS OCCUPATION IN 1968 AND IT WILL DISCONNECT YOU. DO YOU THINK AT LEAST LOSE A RANK YOU HAVE WORKED FOR 12 HOURS? HAH OR PIT. IT WILL TAKE IT RANK BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT ""VERY GOOD"". so I say okay, I'm going to put the game as a killer .... hah it helped you fucking wire, I'll kill all 4 and me it .... well guess what? TAKE A RANK FUCK WHAT DO I HAVE TO KILL THE ENTITY TO GET 1/6 OF THE PIPES I NEED TO RANK UP? JUST THAT THE GAME DISCONNECTS ME BECAUSE THEIR SERVERS ARE ALSO FUNCTIONAL AS A HANDLESS TYPE IN THE TANK. END, I'M AGAINING THIS GAME BUT I WILL PLAY THE SAME BECAUSE IT'S AN ADDICTIVE SHIT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I'm fucking this community from now on, so I'm doing a list of brainlitters who should be treated. if you come across one of these fighters in the game, leak it right away :) I won't update their names unless someone asks for it because these guys are about as fucking as Russian kids in csgo. Clarification: I'm not toxic, I just don't get fucked up by some selfish kids on the net. Only after playing this game do I really lose my temper, that's all. So I apologize for the various ""expressions"" in this review. The list of jerks, compared to which even chernobyl in 1986 was less toxic: .... anyway has no lmao / definition of dickness (give this a report before you leak it :)) .... classic Czech List of morons who are ruthless (Tunnel, faceCamp , etc.) [only the worst]: .... of course russian / tunnel .... is so bad that he has to facecampit for myerse with ew3 ready at the end of the game. in addition, it is only rank 13 and has only one perk, a classic no lifer. - ... Tunnel campici rusak, has only 50 hours ... ""Sucks my cₒ𝒸k"" - TIDE 2020 .... boreček does not even want to leave respect and swears at me in the profile, a classic toxic rusak. You better not write anything to his profile .... ..... camping, tunneling and in the end I'm bad because I used ""BUG"", one can't even do a battlepas challenge ""fall from great height in a chase two times"" without so that some dick wouldn't dump him and tunnel. This person will curse you for using ""second life perks"" (Dead hard, Adrenaline blagh blagh blagh) in the meantime, all you have is Spine chill, Windpows of opportunity and inner strenght, perks that will help you in the chase, just like the Enduring perk. while playing The Nurse. Tengle's selfish dick is on shoot. Fuck me. .... a classic bad waste that can do shit for the whole game, it has to tunnel, of course only me, donwul me only once for the whole game. And when they finished the generators, we had to give the red sea (of course, only after I tunneled right after I got out of the hook) so that by chance his rank 13 ass didn't get -1 pip.

"Don't buy it! ! ! ! ! One of the stupidest games I've played. The game is from 2011. You play the elite sniper Tyler Wells and support a rebellion on the Latin American island of Trueno. Now about the game: The levels are linear and are located in the jungle. I like the graphics very much, but I don't have any great demands: P The opponents' AI is just plain stupid. I aim my sniper rifle at an enemy and kill them. Well, I just don't have a silencer on my gun. Usually everything is on the alert, but not here. The other enemies are doing their rounds normally and are not looking for me. I also got stuck in many places in the game or couldn't jump over it - pure frustration. In other places you can just walk through a rock like that; o How can you throw such a game on the market? I will probably never understand. There are also places in the game where you control a soldier with an assault rifle and all that stuff. The recoil of the gun is awesome. I always think ""Oh, I'm going to tear my arm off"". No joke, it is torture to aim an assault rifle. As soon as you pull the trigger it tears immediately. I expect that from soldiers in basic training and only in the first week, but not from elite soldiers -.- Conclusion: hands off! I bought the game from humblebundle or bundlestars. And that too was too much money. ",False,False

"Gets boring very fast. you can't really stand up to the guards with shields, so you just wait for them to turn around while you wait in a corner outside of their vision. The ""reverse horror"" concept seems pretty cool, but the game just seems like it's cruising off of the cool concept. The game both feels like it's not giving you much free choice, whenever they don't want you to do something they just stick a shield guy and an obvious way to kill him (holes in the ground, objects, etc) without explanation of the finer mechanics, like the power box, which I still don't know what it does.

"I would like to tell you what PUBG is. This game I learned about back in Alpha, but a fat friend Ilyukha said that the product is raw and unplayable. But I could buy it and get the first case with very expensive skins. Later I still bought PUBG and was not disappointed in anything. It was 2017 and we all played this game with squads and received cases for which the game paid off several times. Over time, these cases began to fall in price and sites for the upgrade of PUBG skins came into play. There was such a cool site where they just gave a dollar every two days, but ..... The developers got drunk and turned off the trade, thereby killing the whole system of earning in PUBG. The game immediately became 200 times less enjoyable, and this was not because I needed money, it was just that earning skins in PUBG brought great emotions: I raised raincoats from nothing in PUBG. The developers gave hope by adding that same damn thing to PUBG, it turned out to be a parachute with a tiger print. A friend said that we will raise 5 million on it over time (not Ilyukha). The idea was to buy an unnecessary limited skin to anyone and sell it a year later for incredible amounts to Chinese collectors. Then more boxes of Shroud and Usatik came out, I'm not a spender, so I bought only the Usatik pack. And my friend (not Ilyukha, we left him altogether and he went crazy (troubles with his head) went to earn money in Fortnite) threw the last money from granny's pension and bought two sets, and then showed her where he spent the money and grandmother felt bad, but he promised she would sell them for $ 10,000 in a year. An hour later, he already regretted the purchase ... Then the first pass came out, it was good, Ilya and I (the same Ilyukha) and I played it. We liked it (not Ilyukha, pass), but besides emotions, we also hoped for the transfer of these items in the future. The second pass for 100 lvl comes out, and my friend (not Ilyukha) and I passed it completely, and from that moment PUBG disappointed us, it was 100 circles of Hell. Then the 3rd pass came out and we did not refuse to buy it, we didn’t pass it, as there was a wound from the last pass, and the verdict was running out with its mathematics. And then the 4th pass comes out, it certainly pleased us, but we already understood that the developers will not make the skins sold and that buying the entire store that they produced was useless, and especially the horse mask that my friend bought (not Ilyukha). Having passed it completely, dying a million times from the Chinese cheaters and mice and bugs in general, I took a vacation from PUBG. And even returned to the CSGO cheat dump and the wonderful game Scum. It turns out 5 pass, I buy it, but my friend does not (not Ilyukha, he does not answer, and not as joyful as he was in 2015, when he went to grade 5, and then stopped). I gave it up (pass, not to Ilyuha, but him too). And now the 6th pass comes out and my friend again does not want to take it, put a bunch of likes on this review so that he bought it. This is where our story comes to an end (the tiger's parachute is still not sold, just like absolutely none of the passes) This game is just like Russia - it has great potential, but Putin - Taisong Young rules. There are very few pleasant things in this game at the moment, and each time you return to it in the hope of a positive one, you get ""pain and suffering"". Thanks to PUBG for the time spent, but that's enough. For some, this is minus 1,000 rubles, but for me personally, somewhere around 20,000 rubles. While writing the review, not a single Ilyukha was hurt. ",False,False

"This review is for the Hangar 6 R&D DLC only and assumes familiarity with the main game. I would not recommend this DLC because a) it's glitchy and b) it doesn't add much. Unless you're interested in the achievements, I'd skip it. In this DLC, you play Bureau agent Nico DaSilva just before the events of the main game. Dr. Heinrich is studying a sleepwalker, and needs your help to sort of break into the sleeper's mind by playing out scenarios in a large hangar that is dressed up to look like a drive-in movie theater. If that sounds weird, well, yeah, it is. The DLC plays out as 11 horde mode missions in the hangar. That's it. You quickly level up DaSilva and his squaddies between missions. The only new combat element is DaSilva's explosives, which are pretty powerful. You also chat with Herr Heinrich and get a little back story. It takes a few hours. First problem: there is a nearly game-breaking graphical glitch that causes everything to hang for five or six seconds every few minutes, even if the main game played just fine. Apparently this problem is quite common. Basically a deal-killer right there. Second problem: the thing makes no sense at all. Like, if aliens invade in the DLC, how is it a surprise that they invade at Groom Range later? And, by the way, since you collect a bunch of backpacks and weapons, why aren't those available at the start of the main game? As DaSilva himself once says, ""This is ridiculous."" That's it.

"A wonderful game to play with a squad of friends. Every game has it's ups and downs. However this game has to be my top grossing FPS game of all time. It may have its issues but it's definitely worth the time. It's crazy how far it has gotten to. The game used to be much better without those microtransactions (cosmetics). But if you think about it they do need money to keep the servers up and to bring out new content, so that's fine. It's not any pay to win situation, it's just cosmetics. It has a lot of support and even test servers.  The support team is definitely doing their job right. If you see it on sale, definitely pick it up, you'll love it despite its flaws. /// This is not the Rainbow Six Siege we all remember, it has gotten to a whole new level and in my humble opinion it is in a very underwhelming state. They only add new content and rework maps to make them 10 times worse. The hit reg and many other issues from year one are still present.

The AI are worse than I ever remember, the hit detection feels worse than the original xbox version for all modes, still no forge, and its just overall worse than any version, especially the vista version.

"Even without the premise of a game that Hi-Rez sued for plagiarism, this project is one big talentless failure that remains in Early Access to this day.

I am not only one having graphic, mouse scrolling issues to name few I went into setup down played to the least graphic , details and played with  fps as well a  2 second mouse click in PC1 takes 5  seconds just to get the mouse pointer to where you want it .

I got no extra battles yet the 2 promised DLC's well be same price and id the base game is this broken worthless Dlc's will be given as well  I am going think long hard before I ever buy from Matrix again I have loads of them on steam and many not sold on steam .  they should be ashamed to have let this go out with such broken game streaming  5 hours at review and I hate it 1000 hrs of PC1 I bought this pre sell based on all the good pre videos been shown . Nope I have a medium set up  quad core can play just about any game I want yet this one is so clunky  poor graphic scroll  mouse scroll is crap I played with video settings  and kept going back to highest setting . My internet is top speed . I beta test for matrix from time to time and am appalled that  they have put out this junk at such high price  My suggestion is  wait 6 months even a year  for them to fix the massive problems in  game play  .

"Although the game makes you feel badass all whilst still remaining to have some king of difficulty, the game has many flaws in the mechanics of the A.I's programming. Instead of making the A.I and yourself feel like you are equals, it instead makes the A.I basically decide when you are allowed to hit it. Instead of allowing the player to make the desicion if they should attack, the A.I is programmed to have only certain moments where it can be hit otherwise it instant blocks/dodges and counters the attack even though the player thought it would be a good time to attack. This makes the game feel very repetetive in the sense that the only difficulty is learning/interpreting when and how to dodge atttacks and when it actually allows you to hit it, which is usually during dialogue or when it is done its attacks. These factors make the combat feel monotous and repetive also due to overdrawn fights, the simularity of the fights, and the lack of animations for different player attacks. ",False,False

The game intro was really cool along with the soundtrack in the background as well later during the character customization to make it sound so heroic. But then after 12 hours of game-play, I realized how repetitive the game actually is which makes the progression very difficult because it seems like the game only has at least 6 or 10 maps through the entire game, so that's pretty boring when you think about it that way. At this point, I'm pretty sure I've been playing in the same maps over 60 times each from difficulty 1 to difficulty 4. Each difficulty has between 10 to 40 missions the higher the difficulty is. Same goes for the monsters since later on, they're the same except they're re-skinned so that's a little bit boring. You get like one or two new times of monsters passed difficulty 3 then 6, but then the further you progress, the more often you'll see them so they're not rare or unique for long. The maps are also pretty small and there's a lot of strange corners here and there for nothing. Other problems are when you're fighting monsters in corners, you constantly have to give orders to your teammates to follow you so you don't end-up squished in there. The world itself seems pretty small since all you have is a tiny headquarter or something with 5 floors which count the mission gate, the elevator, a lab with a hallway, 3 doors and 2 out of 3 which are almost always locked, a veteran quarter with the same thing as the lab, and the recruit floor, which is also the same thing as the two others and some sort of research floor, which is the same thing as well. The story is great despite the fact that the created character doesn't talk and reply to everyone by nodding all the time or gesturing once in a while as if they were mute, but you have the option to choose the voice to be heard during battle so that makes things weirder. The quotes from each NPCs are also very repetitive, during and after a mission completed, the same quotes will come back almost every time. And if you decide to do a mission alone, your character will talk to himself or herself as if there was a group with them. I still couldn't figure out if the created character had a level or something, but gearing up later is highly focused on crafting and grinding through the game. The character creation is pretty awesome however. I like the clothing styles, it's very similar to S4 League or Phantasy Star Universe if anyone know one of those games. Every NPCs has their own and unique personality. If there's someone who likes Borderlands 2 and/or is a fan of the Mechromancer, the character named Kanon is pretty much just like her. Same awesome and hilarious personality for instance. The game lack of combos and fancy finisher or ultimate against monsters. After all, you're supposed to be some kind of monster slayer or something, and other NPCs are claiming that your character has special powers or abilities at the beginning of the game which other people don't seems to have. But that's not really the case, the NPCs can do the same things you do, so you're not really unique at the end of the day. A bit later through the game, you unlock some abilities called ""Predator moves"" but these things are nothing special, everyone can do it. Their only purpose is to give you some self-buffs or party-buffs or debuff your enemies as you devours them them with it. There's some bugs here and there, but they're minors at least. Monsters have no boundaries, they can hop and run out of the map unexpectedly while you're forced to remain on the map due to invisible walls. You can shoot them if they're out of the map unless as long as they're not clipping through buildings and stuff which can also happen if they jump away from you and decide to flee. Fortunately, it's a rare issue. It happened to me only two times or so. But it can be annoying when their weak points are the ones constantly clipping through stuff. I can't really recommend this game if you plan on having a lot of fun for hours, fighting enemies here and there, but it's a good way to kill boredom. Apparently this game is a port from the PS Vita so that would explain a few things. I would totally recommend Devil May Cry 1, 2, 3 or 4 over this game anytime however, but then you won't get the sweet character customization. If I could fix this game myself, I would throw the fighting style of .hack//G.U from the PlayStation 2 (A remake is coming to PS4 and PC by the way), and add much more maps to fight in along with new monsters for a better and bigger variation. Then the game would be great! But for now, I think I'll just keep playing it for the story and once I'm done with the story, I'll just move on to something else.",False,False
"I love this genre, and the very graphics of the old times impressed me. But in Early Access, it's like sitting on a wet chair - while it dries, it will rot inside. After reading the negative reviews, I prepared to taste all the ""joys"" of this project, accepting the fact that I subscribed to something almost alive. It turned out that this almost alive died and stank even before I started playing. Upon entering the game, I was greeted in style by a splash screen with a title and an inscription below. I clicked on the keyboard and mouse, then clicked on the gamepad. Does it even live through? The prayers were answered and the game started. It was launched, fortunately, not in Polish, and even with a small screen resolution. And the settings look like you are playing ""Feel Dumb"". Okay, I hope the settings are something I don't need to go back to anymore. It started. The characters began to speak terribly annoying. For fun's sake, I turned off the possibility of this muttering. Voila, in the meager settings it is possible to replace this nonsense into English! Poor that poor fellow who did not find this option and his ears fell off. Let's remember. Let's continue ... Controlling with a gamepad? Forget it. It is there, but better not. Moved to the keyboard and what the hell ?! Why does it work so badly? No cursor for you, go to the objects and press. Be prepared for the character to go back and forth and disobey you. And you know, the testers, having received this project, simply said -. I started playing for the chained robot Bella. Someone named Robert, a green crocodile, chained me. He gave me a dubious assignment - to make a cocktail with 4 ingredients. I had a choice of half a human brain, a sawed-off leg, canned pineapple, a pinch of black pepper, olive oil, cheese and tomato. Do I have a cocktail recipe? No. Will this green blast give me the recipe? No. I spent 40 minutes on this, did I cook it? No. The inventory is pressed on, then you need to scroll on and when choosing, press on. I don't understand why it was necessary to do such a horror? I regard these kinds of things as disrespectful to those who will play this. It is impossible to get used to this control, it is daunting and nothing will save it. I would give this project a second chance, but the absolute nonsense in the first task and the clumsy management completely discouraged me from trying to play it. Maybe at the release stage.

Same idea as before, but totally different mechanics. The forum seems active, and Dejobaan pretends to listen. Heck, it even says so in the Early Access Description.

It seems to have a ton of promise if Dejobaan would actually work on it, instead of putting out games like DRP. If you buy this now, you get a very basic Alpha with a very small handful of levels.

"Elite Dangerous is a space/flight simulator, with an emphasis on trade, as well as elements of action and mining. It is also an ""MMO"".  In Elite: Dangerous you start out in a basic ship in the same general starting area as everyone else. From here on, you're free to go about and make something of yourself in the universe. At first, you believe there is a lot of options available to you in Elite: Dangerous, but you start to realise there is little depth to the game, and everything is tedious and slow.  Elite: Dangerous is a meandering grind for money. With this money, you can buy and outfit a new ship, to make more money at a faster pace. However, there are huge gaps between prices of ships, and outfitting a ship in the best gear usually costs twice as much as the ship. Because of this, the grind never gets easier, just harder and more tedious.  There's three things to do in Elite: Dangerous: Trade, Combat, and Exploration.  Trade consists of either taking up trade contracts to earn measly amounts of cash, smuggling illegal goods to make slightly better amounts of cash, or finding a trade route on your own or online to make as much profit as possible. You can also mine goods to sell instead of simply trading. However, mining is hardly ever worth the time and effort, as there's only 2-3 goods that can only be obtained via mining, and therefore the only ones which turn a profit. Finding these goods take a long time, and you usually spend most of your earnings on more drones as well as fuel.  Combat consists of either bounty hunting, piracy, or civil/faction war combat bonds. Fighting NPCs is fun at first, however after so much fighting you start to realise each NPC has the same flight pattern. Due to this, combat becomes dull after a while. You can always try PvP, but this (shoddy) ""MMO"" uses peer-to-peer instances, consisting of 30 players each. If you're lucky, you may run across another player. Good luck killing them though, as many experienced players simply press Alt + F4 to close their game, completely removing them from the instance. This means all the effort you spent trying to kill them has gone to waste.  Finally, exploration is another option. Elite: Dangerous has around 400 billion procedurally systems. When you eventually get the money, you can gear out a ship for exploration. From here, you can head out into uncharted space, scanning stars, planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. Depending on what you find, exploration will net you various amounts of cash. Usually, scanning everything is not worth it, and people just target the most valuable bodies. A huge downside to exploration is you're screwed if anything goes wrong. If you run out of fuel, if you overheat and blow up, anything that'll strand and/or destroy you will make all your effort go to waste. You will spend weeks exploring space, and just as much time getting back to sell your data, and it can all be lost in a second if something goes wrong.  As mentioned earlier, Elite: Dangerous is an MMO. However, it's buy to play and doesn't require a subscription. There is no dedicated server though. You're connecting to other players via peer-to-peer networking, which has many flaws. You can be dropped from an instance at any time, which can also cause you to drop out to the main menu. Players can simply end the game process or Alt+F4 to drop from the instance and suffer no consequences, such as being destroyed by NPCs or other players alike. Single player requires an always online internet connection, which leads one to believe the ""MMO"" nature is a front for Always-Online DRM. The shoddy and lacklustre MMO side of the game is what leads me to this thought.  Elite: Dangerous is also a grindfest, with no real goal. You can rank up three different categories, earn measly amounts of credits via contracts, or just trade/fight/explore until the grind bores you. Your only goal is getting the next ship, to grind even more whilst being illuded into believing the grind is going quicker.  Elite: Dangerous has a lot of content on the surface, but deep down the game is empty and void of everything. Much like space, in Elite: Dangerous there is nothing.  Overall, Elite: Dangerous will keep you addicted for a few days, but eventually fall flat if you're not the type of person who loves to meaninglessly grind in games. I cannot recommend this game at $60. Instead, get it on sale for 50% off or more.  If you're in the market for a space combat & trade sim, check out X3, as well as previous X titles. There's also some space games on Early Access now, which deliver a lot more than Elite: Dangerous.  Now I'd like to move onto Frontier Developments. A company that has screwed over people who backed via Kickstarter, as well as changing promises and borderline lying to people.  For a start, they lied to people about offline mode. The game was never an ""MMO"" at the start. It never required an online connection, until they suddenly changed this in one of the alphas. Many called for refunds, and Frontier did not wish to grant them.  Next off, let's move onto expansions. As an ""MMO"", Elite: Dangerous will be getting a series of expansions. However, they work differently to other games. Instead of getting an expansion that is content complete, you pay for the initial set of content, and hope they add more over time. You can pay extra for the ""alpha"" version of the expansion, getting earlier access to lacklustre content.  The first expansion to be releasing is Horizons. This adds planetary landings. The first set of planets that support landing are rocky planets with no atmosphere. They stated they ""hope"" to add more in the future, not that they ""will"". There's no guarantee your expansion will be complete. When you buy an expansion, you're paying for content to be given to you over time, rather than having much of it up front.  But how much does all this cost? $60, however for a limited time you can get a $15 discount. But don't worry! If you don't own the game, you get the best deal! Buying the game for $60 will give you both the base game and the expansion, meaning everyone who paid before you gets screwed over, whilst you're rewarded for buying in late!  I further cannot recommend this game due to Frontier's terrible business practices. They're shady, quiet, and very anti-consumer. Do not support anything they do.",False,False

"The most exciting thing to do after 10 minutes of loading in is to sit in a lobby for another 10 minutes and wait for someone to leave as soon as a heist starts so that you have to immediately requeue for another 10 minutes. On average, you're lucky to get a mission done once every hour and even luckier to spawn into an online lobby where a modder isn't automatically blowing every other player up. But that's not it. One of the most recent updates released Opressor Mk 2 which is essentially just the ""win everything, immediately"" option for any tasteless player wanting to take out what little fun is left in the game. The Oppressor (or noob bike, as I call it) launches missiles and has pretty well the best mobility in the game out of every vehicle. Not sure what 5,000 IQ developer thought adding an overpowered item locked behind a paywall was a good idea but that's exactly what happened.

"PRO: - probably extremely many options - 4K support CONS: - bugs wherever you look - some menus even Japanese in the English language selection - even fewer resources than the RPG Maker MV already had - extremely confusing overlay - missing essential functions - none German RESULT: At the moment I would not recommend it, for the reason that bugs make the program almost unusable. The tutorial already teaches you how to program bugs. In addition, it tends to get stuck, has display errors or brings up bullshit. Often it wants to be selected by one of the menu items that are not there. In addition, some of the menus are still in Japanese. If you are also hoping for a few free resources, I can disappoint you, even the lean RPG Maker MV has a lot more to offer here. The menus are more reminiscent of the confusing 001 Game Creator instead of the clear RPG Maker MV. I also miss essential functions here, such as a sprite, tileset, sound and music editor. Of course there are also free alternatives as second programs, but it would be great to have a complete package. What is a mega no-go for me, the editor is not available in German. Of course, I also speak English as far as possible, but work is more relaxed in the native language. After all the negatives, I also have to mention the few positive sides, because if you take the time and invest hundreds of hours to learn the program, you will probably get a very freely usable tool. I also think it's great that it also supports native 4K, hats off. Aspects like sound, music and resources are not to be evaluated in the lean package. I will try the tool again if there is another free weekend in an updated version, but until then the tool is unusable for me and even the 001 Game Creator offers more overview and help here.

I understand better than many that the public loves everything unusual and _incomprehensible_. But the secret is good when it doesn't turn into the Scooby Doo animated series!

"UPDATE -- I can no longer recommend this game on PC, as it is still broken and no longer being supported.

All in all, I recommend the game, but unless you are a die-hard fan it may be worth waiting until the glitches are fixed.

Cons: Online mode seems to be down every day. When online mode is up, it is very laggy. Game often crashes or freezes.

The most fun that comes out of this game is the goofs you will have with your friends, however if you don't have 16 players the game is heavily favored for the monster since it's health doesn't scale to the player count which limits the fun that can be had.

After the outburst, let's go now without explaining the porq gives negative analysis: First of all I want to make it clear that the game is good, but this port was made on the thighs, if you are reading this you want to buy to play online you can expect to spend hours of anger, out of nowhere your friends fall or you yourself fall and you can't go back anymore, the worst thing is that when you go online the game adjusts the difficulty for the 4 players (it makes the stop harder) but the room falls (which happens frequently) you stay in offline mode and there is no way to go back online until the end of the mission, the problem is that the game does not return to the standard difficulty offline, he simply understands that he still has 4 players in the session and leaves in his satan mode for 4 player s, the real problem with this is that you may be already at the end of the mission and that happens, so you can’t finish it just because of the difficulty, and neither will your friends, that is time wasted for nothing, and then you have to go back from square one redoing the mission Second, the game does not support widescreen, eyefinity and surround monitors or even talk ... Pqp we are in 2018, a large majority of the guys no longer use 16: 9, and the guys come with this , capcom launching this game without wide support is at least shameful.

"I thought this game was the sequel to the true roller coaster tycoon, but when I opened the lid, it felt completely different from the roller coaster tycoon that I thought.. The balance is also weird, and the location balance is not right when placing rides or shops, and above all I play roller coaster tycoon for fun decorating around, but I can only make the decorating around it in a limited way, and what I made earlier can not be used outside of the building. In the beginning, the motion sickness index is serious even with the basic roller coaster, and if you want to hire an employee, you have to create a separate building to be hired, and it's good to come out on your own, but the only drawback is not being able to specify the location. However, the number of employees is also limited. In other words, only 3 people per building and maximum 10 people can be supported. And for each part (clown, mechanic, cleaner, doctor) you have to build a building. In order to hire an additional employee, there is a lot of hassle of having to rebuild a building, and it takes up a lot of space. And if you want to expand the park area, you need to buy more land with money like Sim City 5 to expand it. I don't understand why I can't install streetlights on overpasses or bridges, and installation itself is impossible. To put it more negatively, this is the recommended PC specification. i5 class CPU, 4G memory, GeForce GTX 460 class... This is my PC specification GeForce GTX 970 and Xeon E3-1231v3 RAM uses 16GB of memory, but even though I didn't have a few buildings or rides, the lag was severe and even stored. When it is loaded, the loading time takes all day. And despite the official Hangulization, the menu and the rides are explained and only the guide part is in Korean. The mission goal and the help part have only X marks, so there is a big disappointment in the Hangul part. Recently, bug fixes were excluded from the official Korean version. If it was previously installed, the Korean dummy file will remain, but if you delete and reinstall it, you cannot select Korean. The conclusion is that it is not optimized (flare), user convenience is insufficient, and whether the opinions of users were respected as to what they did during the Early Access period..... I really don't know. If you want to complete it with a collection, I personally think that it is better to buy it when it comes out at a bargain price. The score for this game is 1 out of 5 stars.

"From the creators of   comes Waifu Hell, a FPS which tries to be as hardcore as Doom, but is so monotone I think it was conceived either as a way to kill people of boredom or just to make the players experience first-hand what hell truly is.

"DO NOT PLAY THIS VERSION. GO WITH THE ORIGINAL.  I heard about the issues that other people were having with this game. Didn't believe it'd happen to me as well. My mistake. Upon installing and running the game, the client would not detect my video card settings properly and left me staring at a blank white screen. Sometimes this would result in killing my CPU and making my computer completely unresponsive. After switching to the onboard graphics card, running the executable, and then going into the settings and turning them down was I able to exit and then run it again via my primary graphics card without any issues. These are clearly issues with the .ini file, among other things... NOT an inability to meet the basic system requirements. Segments of the game (namely exterior backgrounds of buildings and added flora) do indeed look much better, but other portions of the game look as if nothing has been done whatsoever (perhaps even made worse), and it really makes me question how this game could double in overall package size with seemingly little changes done to the textures. I've experienced recurring sudden crashes which result in several minutes to hours of progress lost. Saving frequently is not even a workaround because when I go to either quicksave or manually save, it often results in a crash as well. None of these issues ever occurred for me when playing the original on several different computers. Why or how this remaster is so screwed up, I'll never understand.

When I had nothing to write, I probably wrote something like this, pretending to be critical and irony, and occasionally getting a good comment from the teacher. In fact, I knew that because It's true that there is nothing in my stomach to do this. The test essay is similar. It’s just a new style of eight-legged essay when you find that you have nothing to write in an emergency situation. You don’t know the so-called maxims and aphorisms, and then add your own thinking.

Silent Hill2 - pyramid-headed (feeling of guilt), the character travels deep into the underground prison through the labyrinths of his subconscious, etc. - everything here is an allegory with a thousand interpretations, everything here serves a single purpose - to reveal the topic. 35mm is a completely different story.

"After about 1.152 hours of playing time I came to the following result -> Uninstalling the game. One or the other question now why, why, why. It should be noted that I've been playing CS: GO since 2015. First of all, all the game modes that exist in-game: -Deathmatch / Death Game -Arms Race / Arms Race -Demolition / Destruction -Hostage Liberation / Hostage Rescue -Bomb Defusion / Bomb Defusion The focus here is mostly on Bomb Defusion and Hostage Rescue in matchmaking / competition cards . Other game modes are just a warm-up for many. What do i like - Card design: In my opinion, an extraordinary card design - Weapon handling: Demanding spray pattern, no RUN-AND-GUN, you have to be able to control the weapon - Team play (5 premate lobby): In a competition you have to play in a team, tactically proceed etc. What do I dislike at all? -In general VAC You just have to say: VAC is rubbish. It only has to be once CS: GO in any sale, then Matchmaking (MM) is absolutely cheated. Well there was a time when every second MM game was a cheater. The result: MM was unplayable. Valve then thought, as well as the OVERWATCH (a selected player looks at a demo of an MM game (10 rounds) and assesses whether the suspect is cheating or hindering the game. This can then lead to an Overwatch ban is converted into a VAC ban) is no longer fast and accurate, well then we just make two different MM quotations. PRIME was born and died again after a week because it just barely worked. The prerequisites for PRIME are that you have stored a telephone number in your Steam Account and have achieved at least Private Rank Lv.20 in CS: GO. Jagut, the cheaters among us just bought a prepaid card, which then makes Prime almost pointless again. From experience, there is only one cheater in every four MM games, which is still far too much. Exactly for this reason, the third-party providers for MM, such as Faceit or ESEA (professional), benefit. Their anti-cheat works far better than Valve's. Just for comparison: 95% of the time you are already banned when you start the cheat, with valve it is not even recognized and it can take a week until the person is banned. -Skins: Skins Well what can I say about that .... ""Skins, but no Skill"" -> that applies to 95% of these players Then also that you give Valve billions of dollars with it, that occurs to me nothing more. I personally had around 500 € as a knife, which I regret in retrospect. Conclusion: A really great game, but it will be destroyed by the cheaters, so it is better to play games with third-party providers, which ensures more fun. ",False,False

"Coming from a fairly large family of seven, board gaming was an integral part of our growing up and the Game of Life is one of those classic games I played and loved as a child. Whenever the games were brought out, it was always on the top of my list. The cars and distinct people pegs, that unmistakable sound of the spinner turning, and all of the cool spaces to land on were just a few of the draws that I latched on to. Can that wonder hold up against an older, less forgiving critic? The Game I won't go into too much detail as I am pretty sure most everyone knows how the Game of Life is played. In short, the game takes the player from approximately being college aged to retirement, going through life events such as choosing a career, getting married, buying a house and having children. Between the major life happenings, the player can also experience plenty of other events that span the winding game track: some that could qualify as midlife crisis, like buying a beach house or plastic surgery, and other, smaller occurrences such as receiving stock, upgrading a computer, etc. The game ends when all players retire and the person with the most money is declared the winner. I do want to note that the version that I am basing this review on is not the same version that I used to play as a child. This review will be done on 2002 version using the 10/02 rev.2 rule set and I can only guess at what version I used to play. It was during the 1980's when I was first introduced, so I am assuming that I played that decades version. I do remember driving Chrysler-esque minivans along the board and according to the Wikipedia entry on The Checkered Game of Life, the minivans were introduced in the 1980s reinforcing my theory. Game pieces It's not really fair for me to comment about the quality of the game pieces in this review as my ""gently used"" copy came from a local Savers thrift store at a whopping cost of $3.99. I will say, however, that the spinner has not changed much with this version. If you spin it incorrectly it will jam up and not spin, which is exactly as I remember it. As much as I love the distinguishing uniqueness of the spinner, no one should have to battle against a game to get it to function correctly. I also wish Hasbro would have included additional Bank Loan notes. Between the 100,000 in college loans and having to buy a house only a few spins later, my wife and I managed to eat up nearly all the notes in most of the games we played. If there were more players, we would have had to come up with a solution. It's hard to say if the problem was due to missing pieces when I purchased the game or if it was shipped with what I had, but it looked like the game was only played once before I bought it as only one blue and one pink people pegs had been detached from their plastic housing. Gameplay For such a complex looking board, Game of Life is one of easiest board games to understand and play. Spin the Spinner, move number of spaces indicated, and then perform action indicated on the space landed upon. Every turn is that or a variation of that, whether it be stopping for a required Stop space, paying out Pay Days that are passed regardless of stopping on them or not, and landing on an optional-to-play blue space. There are some differences in this version compared to the 1980s version. One is that stocks certificates are purchasable and the player earns money for each time the Spinner lands on the number of the stock. Gone are the times of buying chances of hitting it big on the betting board, which makes me sad. I enjoyed spinning for the winnings Another variation is that no spins are made for money at marriage and adding children, instead you get Life Tiles (discussed below); how dull. I seemed to remember giving money to the person who ended up getting married first, which added some value to being in the lead. Also in this version kids are absolutely worthless. There is one, maybe two, spaces on the board where you owe money based off the amount of children you have, but other than that, they just add color to your car. And those Life Tiles, what are those about? They only make the game even more random. I could understand if there were more interactions with them throughout the game, like what happens with the Athlete career, but there aren't. There are a few other minor variations, selling your house (for potential profit) and purchasing a new one, night school, and changes in available insurances, but they are fairly insignificant to the game. Final Thoughts Whether it be the changes in the rules or just the fact that I am not a kid anymore, but the Game of Life just doesn't hold on to the appeal that it used to have for me. I still find the game fun, but I don't have that wonder of experiencing the story of the game that I used to. My mind is now more focused on critically examining the mechanics of the game and it doesn't hold up as it is completely luck based. It's all in the draw of your career/salary cards, the number that turns up on the spinner, and the value of the Life Tiles at the end of the game. For players who have fond memories of older versions, I would not suggest this version over what you are used to; however, if you have not had the chance to experience this game or want to play it with your children, then I say go for it. Your children will still enjoy this game with the excitement of experiencing all the cool events and will be fun for you as well, just not nearly as much as when you were experiencing it as a child.

"The game is generally normal (at first glance), an ordinary grind, the graphics are so-so (if you compare with the same CODE VEIN, then the graphics in this miracle are at zero). There is even a plot of 5 minutes of videos at the beginning of the game, in principle, this is the whole plot. The biggest problem is the frequent interruptions in the work of servers due to overload (because there are only 2 servers) and for me personally, this drawback negates all the advantages of the project (somehow I don’t like to wait for the search for servers and then see a crash from the game, since they are overloaded) ...

"For the full review click  Eternity: The Last Unicorn is an action adventure game with a hint of RPG sprinkled on top where the combat is fairly hard compared to an average RPG and that might very well come as a shock for folks who are interested in it solely because they like unicorns. I mean, who doesn’t? They are magical beings with the power of friendship bracelets and they can stab you in the butt in a heartbeat. It’s not Dark Souls hard, but it’s not casual in the least. I have to say the combat honestly isn’t unfair, it’s just tough. At least, that is until you get to some of the boss fights. In particular, there is one boss that can nearly ruin the player experience within a few hours of gameplay. That said, the game is not unplayable in the least, but the bigger issue at hand is that you often fight the camera angles and glitches more than the monsters. GAMEPLAY If you can’t handle a Soulsborne style of combat then I’d say steer clear of this title. Players are quite vulnerable to attacks as only a few blows will kill you. For Soulsborne vets, this won’t be an issue. Enemies often gang up on you in groups and you can withstand only a few hits before you are dead. There is a dodge ability, which is quite fast, overly fast even, but it does not always work because you will get stuck on geometry or simply surrounded by enemies and be unable to escape. So your only option is to run backward, try to get the camera to give you some idea of where you are, and wait for them to run after you so you can attack maybe two at a time and survive. There are several issues with the combat. First and foremost is that the camera is fixed and rather difficult to work with. You will have to move in and out of frame just to be able to see what is going on, let alone attack an enemy. Often you will be walking backward and shooting arrows or swinging a sword, hoping for the best because you can’t see anything in front of you due to the camera. This happens frequently throughout the game, even in boss fights. It’s as if the game has no regard for the player knowing what is around them. During a boss fight, several times I would try to land an attack while looking straight through the middle section of the boss and no line of sight. There are old games games that do fixed camera position well, like Onimusha, but Eternity: The Last Unicorn‘s attempt to emulate the camera angles of those old games simply does not work at all. There is also a wolf boss about a quarter of the way through the game and it is all out of balance. I honestly rage quit the game after trying to beat it for over an hour. He constantly faces forward so there is no way for a side attack with the sword unless he starts using his special attacks. And if I attacked with a sword he would be less aggressive, yet the sword was nearly impossible to beat him with because I couldn’t dodge him in time, so using a bow is the best method….except that you rarely get a chance to move away long enough to charge the bow because the room is too small. You can tell it’s too small because the wolf boss glitches out now and then as he backs up. You’ll need to grind at least 4-5 more levels and carry a unicorn’s buttload of health with you to be able to beat it. This is not good since most folks will arrive at this boss at roughly lvl 10-11, and they will need to be a lvl 14-15 in order to beat that wolf. Expect the wolf boss to be harder to beat than pretty much all of the bosses after him, I kid you not. On the subject of bosses, I feel they often have hitboxes that are extra wide, so even if you dodge you will still likely get hit unless there is some additional space between you and the boss. Not all bosses were like this, but many at least felt like this. Dodginig into the boss seemed to help sometimes. It could be they have a longer invincibility frame or something. Half my dodges would not work against some of them, even though they worked fine against mid-bosses. Granted, being able to dodge is assuming you can see the space between you and the enemies because the camera angle makes it so that it can be difficult to trust your depth perception. Even knowing where the edge of the arena is can be tough because of the camera angle, and you’ll take damage because while it may look like you are far enough away from the boss to avoid getting hit, you actually aren’t. On top of that, they have incredible amounts of health, meaning it could take forever as you chip away with 1-2% attacks to defeat them if you are even slightly underleveled. Expect to be dodging and kiting for ages with weapons that do very little damage unless you grind a lot to get OP and even then it’s still a kite-n-slash drawn out dance-a-thon. Another issue is that most of the boss battle arenas are too small, making it hard to dodge because, just like the regular enemies and bosses, you too can get stuck on geometry. I had two instances where my character was jammed on some geometry like a tree root or something, unable to attack or dodge while the enemy quickly killed me. I also had an instance in the Jotundrir Cave where my character, Bior, simply refused to attack any more and just stood still in the water. He would also occasionally disappear in the water while dodging, though still be vulnerable to attacks. The swamp tentacle boss just glitched out on me and froze, but at least my character could stand there and shoot arrows endlessly until it died. When fighting Naglfar the Viking, I found there was a location near the front of the arena where Bior would freeze up and get killed. That happened twice and it sucked because that was one of the few camera angles where I could judge my distance from the boss correctly.  When fighting with Aurehen in the Fallen Woods, I switched to a sword and suddently the sword disappeared and she started whacking monsters with her bow, even though I had the sword correctly selected in the weapon guide in the left corner of the screen.  Also, Aurehen froze in place when going back to the Valkyrie, who apparently only said to give my Wisdom move a try.  It was a very frustrating playthrough. Backtracking is an intrinsic aspect of the game, so expect to be running around in the same areas repeatedly for a fetch quest of some kind, fighting the same group of monsters over and over, and then finally getting some sort of unlock only to repeat the process again. It’s helpful to level up, but beyond that, the game just gets repetitive really fast because the game world is simply not all that interesting. That leaves the player with mostly trying to enjoy the combat as the sole reason for continuing as running in circles is a chore and while there are some unlockable hidden areas, the payoffs are just not particularly thrilling. I sort of liked the combat. It’s not easy and that’s fine by me, but I just didn’t think the storyline and experiences with enemies and bosses were worth the effort to continue playing for long. VERDICT While I see lots of folks complain about the combat, I don’t see that as the main issue. Yes, it’s a tough game and too hard for the likely casual crowd that saw the word Unicorn and immediately wanted to look at one. It’s not horrible, even if the movement does feel somewhat slow at the onset. What is more annoying is that it is a little glitchy, with geometry playing havoc on whether or not you can actually pull off an attack at times. However, the biggest issue for me is the camera, it’s downright bad and I don’t mind fixed camera angles if done well, but that is not the case with this game. I just got so tired of having to move back and forth from one framed area to the next just to be able to see what is going on. That should not be the case. I totally get the idea of trying to make the fixed camera like older console titles, but it doesn’t work here in the least. Also, no achievements unlocked all the way to the end for me.",False,False

"I think that after playing about 200 hours of this game, I can objectively tell about it. This game pleased me, the gameplay is good.

"- A healthy future is unthinkable! A healthy future is unthinkable, both due to producer / publisher thinking and lost player values! I know that, I'll say that. It didn't happen ... The story it contains is frighteningly banal. The captain of a ship (Jackal) dies and you become the new captain of that ship. With your new team of which you are the captain; You can take the task you want, whenever you want. How do you try to apply this system, which is seen in open world games for the first time in a series like Call of Duty, in a famous game by moving along a straight story line? Come on to the section where people sweep the hair for Activision ... The zombie mode, which is hoped to come out beautiful every year, which is considered to be a real ""game"" in itself. Yes, there were examples, but I haven't seen such a thing ... I didn't really. I've been waiting for the computer in my hand for 8 years. Believe it or not, but I've been struggling for a new computer for 8 years. It was late but it was not difficult, somehow I was able to collect the system I wanted. Prior to my access, as a CoD veteran, this game was the first on my ""games to play"" list. I was someone who loved futuristic themes, and years later I was going to play one of the latest games of my favorite series, at the highest settings. What was the result? Frustration. I really got tears in my eyes, I swear to God, my throat got knotted at billahi. Such a bad game did not suit the producer of Modern Warfare. If I think about forty years, I wouldn't expect such a job from Infinity Ward, the second biggest designer of Call of Duty - bigger than either of the two big firms for me because of Treyarch, World at War and Black Ops. The zombie mode that Treyarch brought to the Call of Duty brand with World at War and Infinity Ward experienced for the first time was terrible. Just like a company like Sledgehammer attempting a production like Advanced Warfare and sitting on its ass ... The same is true for Infinity Ward right now. Since the experience bars related to this area are less full, they cannot produce quality works. Treyarch is the only company that can bring it all together. World at War in the past, Black Ops in the middle, Black Ops in the distance 3. Ben talking the facts about the good, the bad; I write the truths and wrongs here. I have no imagination. There are no actors. It is so bad that there are no actors. That's why I experienced it alone. While the number of players in the 2010 Black Ops-I accept the explosion point of Call of Duty- can reach 500 instantaneously, the situation of Infinite Warfare from 2016 is no different from Ghosts. The multiplayer and zombie mode serves a total of 300, or maybe 400 people. It was the earliest game to die ... Even though its trailer never deserved to be among the ""Most Disliked Videos in YouTube History"", the work done is really bad. For the sake of misunderstanding, I am not praising the players here for predicting the following situation I am facing. The mob contributing to these movements ""unconsciously"" has a very different purpose. Do not understand anything, I always say and repeat; These are uninformed / unintelligent guys who haven't finished even a single player of Call of Duty. The customization system is not enough, the number of Killstreak / Scorestreak is very low, the Class logic is not settled, the current panel is not user-friendly, the number of weapons and additional parts is still much less ... In a game that stands out with its multiplayer system, even one of those I mentioned. not in a ""positive"" position. Personally, I could not finish this game. It was the first time that I couldn't finish a Call of Duty game ... The veteran I couldn't stand it, I couldn't finish it. I couldn't finish because I put my health ahead of everything. My break point was the moment we met with the mission system of the spaceship we were the new captain of. I don't know how they could make such a system go to such a game. They turned the game into a MMORPG. There are main quests and optional quests; choose what you want, play and come back. Repeat later. Choose what you want, play and come back. Repeat ... Repeat. Where is that straight trajectory that tied my hand and wiggled me to reach the end? Why am I moving on my own? Is this game open world? How come one of the biggest game series in the world can be tried such a shitty, crashing system, I don't understand. Is this the practice board? When you said that I would innovate, you messed up the whole business. I see that Infinity Ward's bar is in 2009. It can't go any further. What does it mean? We will wait for Black Ops 4 altogether and we will not list any company that does Call of Duty other than Treyarch. ",False,False

"I still don't recommend this game at its current price.  The game is very unstable and loves to CTD, especially when doing the 2k showcases.  Lots of the CAW parts have severe clipping issues, as well as some clipping issues while in-ring.  The graphics are nothing special; essentially being the same as 2k19, so nothing to rave about.  Overall game play and mechanics are not too bad, but could definitely be better.  Universe mode is improving, albeit slowly.  It still needs some work, but it's getting to a good place.  The 2k Showcases are actually not too bad, except for the constant CTD's.   When the Showcases have been stable, I've enjoyed the challenge (just fix the damn CTD's).

"English and Portuguese Review. English: I'm basing things in my own experiences. From these 4 hours i spent in this game, 2 of them i spent trying to fix it instead of playing it. First, if you have 2 GPUs (i own a laptop), there's a big chance the game won't launch at all  and it will display this error message: ""Graphics Device is Invalid"". If you own an Intel HD Graphics, the game will probably launch with this GPU instead of whatever other GPU you might have, this is the only way it can work. I managed to get around and force the thing to run with my Geforce GPU (not through the Control Panel, however), but that's just one problem... If you want to play this game with a controller (this game is pretty much a console game) you'll probably have more problems. The controls are all messed up. I was using a Xbox One Controller and i could only shoot by pressing the Menu Button, look up or down by pressing RT or LT and so on.... There are some workarounds on Steam forums, and it works - sometimes. I was playing the game just fine a few weeks ago, today i tried again and the controls were all messed up again. When it works, all the buttons work as intended and you don't need to do anything else besides chosing either inverted Y axis or not, but when it doesn't, you're screwed. I'm out of patience and don't want to lose more time with this game, since it's not that good, anyway. This game is quite bland, with annoying and uninteresting characters and gameplay. It's just another typical third person shooter but with weak gunplay. Games like Gears of War, Vanquish, Max Payne and Control are infinitely better than this thing. Don't waste your money with it. You better off playing something more interesting and less buggy. There are some choices i regret doing in my life, buying this game is one of them. Português: Gostaria de deixar claro que isto não é uma análise, mas sim um aviso: Este jogo é muito bugado. Se você possui um PC ou Laptop com 2 placas de vídeo, ele provavelmente vai dar erro na hora de você jogar. No meu caso, eu tinha uma placa Geforce e uma Intel Graphics (que todos sabem que é um lixo). Se você selecionar a placa da Intel Graphics no Painel de Controle da Geforce (porque o jogo em si não consegue sequer reconhecer a placa Geforce no menu de configurações), você conseguirá jogar, mas com performance abaixo do esperado. Se você trocar pela Geforce, o jogo não roda...Depois de muitas tentativas, consegui reverter esta situação, e aí comecei a ter outro problema: Controle. Eu jogo a maioria dos games meus de PC na TV e geralmente com controle. Como esse jogo é mais estilo console, não pensei duas vezes, usei o controle do Xbox One para jogar, mas o problema é que os comandos estão todos trocados e zoados. Exemplo: Você atira com o botão Menu do Xbox One, você olha para cima e para baixo com os botões RT e LT em vez de usar o joystick (???). Existem formas de consertar isso, mas acontece que nem sempre funciona. Isso mesmo, nem a solução pra consertar esse problema funciona toda vez. Passei mais que a metade do meu tempo nesse jogo mais tentando consertá-lo do que jogando. Não vale o esforço, até mesmo porque o jogo é muito básico. Gameplay chato, personagens irritantes, locais esquecíveis...não vale a pena perder tempo tentando consertar um game que sequer graça tem. Quer jogar um Third-Person Shooter legal? Vai de Gears, Vanquish, Control, Max Payne, Quantum Break e etc...passe longe desse aqui. Nem na promoção vale. ",False,False

"Man of Medan had the potential to be a great horror game, considering its setup but, unfortunately, it fails completely on all aspects of the genre. 👍  +Lighting and textures are high quality. 👎 -Cheap scare simulator. -Horrible voice acting. -The plot starts interesting but goes to ♥♥♥♥ once you figure it out. The story starts simple and good enough, a ship that carries soldier coffins and some mysterious boxes is stranded in the middle of the ocean when a storm hits it and it unleashes what was in the mysterious sealed boxes and everyone onboard start to see things which quickly turns into a horror show.  Fast forward years later the main characters are introduced and they go on a boat trip to scuba dive in the ocean and find the location of the Manchurian gold. As you slowly progress through pointless nonsensical writing, things start to go wrong and end up on the ship Medan. As you can imagine things take a terrible turn and based on ur stupid choices characters may die or not. You start to realize what goes on on the ship and once you figure out things, the horror aspect just goes poof in the air.  I honestly just want to tell you what happens to avoid you the pain but I don't like to spoil things but don't expect anything good.  And just how it ends the post ending scenes are even more stupid than the rest of the game.  If you do want to know the main plot here's the gist of it, huge spoilers ahead:  Story rating: 6/10 So the plot is bad, maybe the gameplay can carry it right? It does not. Ever played walking simulators or Telltale games? Well cut half the gameplay, make the movement slower and you have Man of Medan.  You walk so little and in the most obstructed mega linear paths that I can't even call it a walking simulator. There are some good aspects and some choices you make matter on who survives or not but most of them are just nonsensical. For example, I found a gas mask and the character never used it and just discarded completely. Another character found a knife and she lost it later in the water, never using it. Maybe there were scenes and choices that could've led to me using them? Probably yes, probably not, but the way it was managed was deplorable, to say the least.  There are some dialogue choices in the game and how you respond it increases your reputation with the characters you speak with or can change your traits. What do these stats and traits do? Not sure. At least they did nothing in my playthrough or at least I felt they did nothing. My characters did not build any relation with one another even though I was nice because the game forced you anyway in dumb situations so what was the point of them? Achievements? Maybe it affects certain scenes? Unknown but does not really matter since if you fail a QTE your characters can and will die, in the stupidest ways. I managed to only get one character killed right before the end only because I got so bored I just stopped paying attention.  How can you add such interesting features that can alter the course of the story, presumably, alongside the most boring gameplay aspects of all time? What and who was behind this decision? Until Dawn had the same mechanics but they emphasized the importance of them throughout the game and the situations made sense. The same company made those games but I doubt the same people worked on both games. I feel like the engine was simply given to a small team and told them to deal with it.  But is it scary? Well if you find cheap scare mechanics scary than I suppose it will be for you because that's what all the game does to frighten you. It puts you in a zoomed-in scene and then just pops something in your face. That's what the developers thought a horror game should be. Think about that.  Gameplay rating: 5/10 Horror games and sound design should always work in perfect harmony. You cannot have a good horror game with bad sound design and Man of Medan has one of the worst sound mixes I've ever heard. From the first minute you start the game you'll notice the voice acting is bad which carries the entire game but not only that the sound effects from the ship and whatnot are so loud you can't even hear the voices of the soldiers. Muffled and poor quality sound effects and cheap recording becomes frustrating. Later in the game, it gets a bit better but at that point, you just won't care or even pay attention anymore. There's no fluidity to how characters talk to one another, one moment they're chill with you than the other they're mad, robotic.  As for the soundtrack, I suppose the few songs present in the game are okay. You won't care much about that anyway.  Audio rating: 5/10 So does the game run well at least? Thankfully it does but it's not an impressive feat because while it has great assets such as detailed textures and impressive lighting, it also looks boring as hell and devoid of details. You are in extremely tight spaces all the time so naturally, it should run perfectly.  Level design is absolutely bad as I mentioned in the gameplay aspect, painfully linear without almost any exploration paths whatsoever on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ huge navy ship. So much potential wasted.  As for bugs, no issues whatsoever.  Graphics, performance and tech analysis score:  6.5/10 So do I recommend Man of Medan? Hell no. Stay away from this terrible game. My search for a good horror game continues.",False,False
"Remember when you’d log into Facebook and boot up one of those little cute pet games where you’d take care of an animal of your choice and get little rewards? That’s what this game feels like, only without the rewards, and someone figured they’d just slap a dating sim somewhere in it. There’s just so much done wrong that I’m not even sure where to start.                                                                            • • • • The characters are honestly the only thing I like about this game, art aside. The diversity is amazing, from size to race it was a breath of fresh air. I respect the developers for being bold enough to place in a trans man, who’d probably be my favorite if not for Anders. The respectful use of pronouns was interesting as well as how they handled delicate topics in general. I was probably impressed most by Felix.   There are a number of cliché ways I expected that to play out, and yet they went a completely different route, I couldn’t have been more pleasantly surprised. The ages have a nice range as well, no more high school drama. Just a bunch of confident adults who know what they want and aren’t afraid to acknowledge their shortcomings. Unfortunately, this is where my praise ends. The story is nonexistent, but I’ll give you a rundown. Your character moved to Rainbow Bay after a nasty breakup, looking for a fresh start and a change in careers. Of course, you learn this all at once during a truth or dare session about midway through the game, but I digress. You came here with the intention of being a well-known photographer, now whether you’ve always had this passion, or it was simply a heat of the moment thing, we have no idea. But the only real-time this comes into play is briefly at a fair, in which you happened to immediately get some big-time offer and gig. I just couldn’t care to be honest, because the game doesn’t have enough to make you care. Your character’s personal life appears to revolve around who your pursuing’s personal life and your dog. BFF just severely lacked enough depth needed to make a lasting connection or leave an impression. This is probably why I have mixed feelings about the romance. It’s not bad by a long shot, but there’s not enough to it. Due to so much focus being put into the dog element of the game it almost feels forgotten about, or like a last-minute addition. Your character pretty much kisses everyone on the first date, and while the kiss is sweet and well written when you consider your interactions with them throughout the game it all moves so quickly. Seriously, what happened to romantic tension!? It’s hard to even know where you stand with some characters because the word friend keeps getting thrown around despite you having kissed or slept with them multiple times. It could’ve possibly come together a bit more smoothly with CGs, however, there are none. At all! Not a single one! I’m so heartbroken. How can you deny me an Anders kiss CG? Or Astrid! It’s just too cruel. On top of that, it bothered me that some characters still openly flirted with characters you were pursuing and neither party said anything or reacted in a way to suggest being uncomfortable. There were a few times where your character expressed disappointment at the word “friend”, but the lack of conviction behind it and the going with the flow was quite irritating, to say the least.                                                                            • • • • Now, I’m not going to pretend that I like stat raisers, but I can often look beyond them if the story and romance are good enough because it’s usually worth the effort, albeit extremely frustrating. The irony here is that the stat raising element was not frustrating at all, rather it was just boring, and I didn’t understand the reason for it. There’s no reward for raising your dogs’ stats outside of getting the valedictorian achievement. I didn’t see an improvement in the dog’s behavior, nor did it seem like having higher stats changed the outcome of specific situations. On top of that, I found that the constant dog events were more annoying than anything and killed any type of potential romantic tension, not to mention it just personally made things awkward at times. It’s honestly quite amusing to me, that the part of the game it felt most if not all, their efforts went into is quite possibly the worst part. Somehow, rather than making me a dog lover, I’m quite glad to own a cat instead. Don’t get me wrong, I love dogs, but this game made me absolutely fed up with them. Finally, BFF lacks basic VN features. You cannot skip, only click super-fast, but not too fast or you risk the game-breaking and having it freeze up for a moment. Not having the ability to skip read text in a visual novel should be considered a crime, and a game sin. I also found that the method of fast clicking sometimes leads to sprites not loading in. There are also a few typos here and there but given all that I’ve mentioned so far, this is simply nitpicking at this rate as there wasn’t an insane amount, just enough for me to notice and make mention of. Nothing another proofread couldn’t fix. My final complaint is that if you like to save before choices, like me, and then go back and try other options, even that’s a hassle. The game doesn’t save at the spot you pick, rather it saves at the beginning of an event itself. To clarify, essentially, it’s like starting a scene all over again if you want to reload and try for other options. When you reload, you have to click back up to the point you saved at which almost ruins the whole purpose of saving in general.                                                                            • • • • Words cannot accurately describe how painful it was to get through Best Friend Forever, nor how completely disappointed I am. Never have I fallen so hard for characters within a game I hate. There’s just so much wasted potential here and I feel like they pushed the dog part so hard that it comes across as cheap and lackluster, rather than cute, adorable, and funny. Originally, I was leaning more towards a neutral rating but after a few more run-throughs, I just have to say no. It’s cute, love the characters and the art, but everything else is just… bad. If the devs released a dating sim without stat raising elements and a fully fleshed out story, I think it has the potential to be mind-blowing.",False,False

"This game is a failure. With a all high record funding from kickstarter (which I participated in), it had the budget of a AAA game.  So to be left with a game this short and boring was a huge disapointment. It proved even old studios that ""seemed"" to know what they were doing can not be trusted with free money. First, this game was supposed to be the full experience at launch but double fine said ""Sorry 1 million dollars wasn't enough, oh geez"" Second, the first act was complete side quests until the very last five minutes. I don't think they knew what they wanted to achieve. Some of those quests were also too far fetched with resolve not making sense. Third, the second act has even more far fetched quests and the story completly derails. You need to use the knowledge from the first character to solve the puzzles presented to the second one and so forth. Even though the characters never interact or talk to each other since they never met! That was immersion breaking and made progress a mess since you never knew if you needed to advace the other character story to find the solution for a puzzle your other first character is stuck in! People blew so much money into this they're forced to like it and I despise this. Don't buy this game and never trust fundraisers for independent games. ",False,False

"An amazing game teared down by imbalance and if you into ranked it is a pay to win sht storm. From ghillie suits that hide your name in PvP to set bonuses giving experience towards combat and life skills. It is like the butterfly effect in the end you will never be able to compete against someone with +10% bonus with the same time available. But not only that this is a good example of how bad micro-transactions can get... Almost for everything you gotta drop down your wallet, bag space? weight? pets? horse flute? not to mentioned clothing since everyone looks the same. A horse flute will cost you 10 bucks which allows you to call your horse within 500m range which should be in the base game for free. While bag space and weight can be earned as quests rewards you will never have enough, barely enough weight to support the slots you have. Really all the gear looks the same except if bought from the store, which is pure cosmetic if you forget the set bonuses... If you don't wanna be busy for 3 hour looting after having killed a pack of enemies you gonna have to buy pets. Pets automatically loot for you every x secs, a pet is again 10 bucks and the timer decreases the higher the pet level is. Pets are being leveled by buying more pets and combining them, every level has so its own bonuses towards life skills and combat. Even if the game was free to play I could still not recommend this micro-transaction scam. The only good things I have to add about the game is the character customization. The world and the combat, the way they don't use any fast travel just adds to the feeling of the world. While the combat takes time to get used to and gets boring fast it is a unique way of doing things. Instead of just spamming 1 2 3 repeat you are actually using your whole keyboard and mouse to pull off the combos. But then again why would you then still add a hot-bar so people can still spamm the buttons. ",False,False

"First of all the efforts put in writing this review are equivalent to the efforts that Infinity Ward put in this game.

Impossible to appear without dying. On the other hand people are extremely bad when they do not hack it is perhaps why some hack. So basically this game is crap, maybe if one day Activision releases a patch that could remove hackers and improve the graphics the game could be less worse. The game is full of kids who whine when they die and blow into their mics as usual. COD Ghost cheats can be found everywhere. I got this game for free but I am requesting a refund for the buyer Activision does not deserve this money. I'd rather give it to a homeless person than to Activision.

"It's not very clear why the developers released ""it"" and what kind of feedback they wanted to get. The demo looks just disgustingly twisted, there are no such vigorous shaders even in games of the 2000s. Everything is blurred, there is some kind of glow around each object, the characters disintegrate into some points when they move, and the further they are, the more they are smeared in the air, it is impossible to look into the sky - the screen is covered with a veil and is illuminated. I can't say for everyone, but many have problems with optimization, for me personally, at any settings, the FPS is kept at 27, be it ultra or minimum, and if you turn the camera somewhere ""wrong"", the FPS can drop to 0. By the very the game, people behave as unnatural as possible, talk like Hollywood actors from movies about saving the galaxy, and Diego speaks so slowly and laughs at every phrase that he wants to deal with him on the spot. Demos should reflect the spirit of the game and show the basic mechanics, but if the full version is executed with similar quality, it will be a failure.

"I remember the first time I got acquainted with this game. It was 2017, I bought this game on ps4 and was amazed. This game was a mixture of the old S.W.A.T. and probably Battlefield. Before that, I played only cs: go so often that I also slipped into a dull trash heap. But this game seemed to me different. She gave hope that good tactical shooters still exist, but no matter how. Over time, any expectations that the developers will stop throwing bolts on this game and fix the previous bugs have completely disappeared. Ubisoft's bad manners even interrupt Valve's bad manners, these people are so greedy and stingy that they do not care about their community at all. Dull events, miserable in every sense operatives, stupid unfounded fixes. This game has lost what it was loved for, what it wanted to play for. I generally keep quiet about the settings, the developers were so lazy to make them that there is not even a function responsible for the volume of steps, or rather it is, but how do you think of where it is located? You won’t guess - in the subtitle volume setting! SUBTITLE BL # TH! There is a disgusting balance in the game: even in the rating you can get players of super low levels, but you are against 100+. Of course, many will say that levels do not affect the skill of the players and will be partially correct. They are right exactly until you are thrown into the team by 2 players of level 30, who say that they just received it and decided to play a new mode for them. Yes, as you already understood, such people were with me on the team with a total of 0 kills. Many people blame the game for not registering hits. And yes, there is such a problem. And in it lies another negligence of the developers - game servers and the game engine. With servers, everything is clear, the developers do not finish them and do not make new ones, it is better to talk about the second engine. If anyone does not know, then the engine of the game is the Anvil Engine. If this still doesn't tell you anything, then you will be surprised. After all, all parts of Assassin's Creed, from the first to Revelations, were made on exactly the same engine, as well as such ""hits"" as Prince Persia (no offense to the 2008 game, it was good, but making a shooter on an engine that is absolutely not intended for such goals is absolutely idiocy), Shaun White Snowboarding and For Honor! What was going on in the head of the developers remains a mystery. Ubisoft create their own problems and it would be fine if they tried to solve them, but alas, c'est la vie. I am writing this review after the latest updates to the game, which finally killed this game. An event that was created for the sake of money and which cannot be called an event, the appearance of simply unbearable bugs: sound, when you could not even understand where the enemy / ally is, gameplay, when the round begins, and you see the map remotely, through textures and not you can even just play. Only one thing can be said unequivocally, it is not worth buying this game for newcomers, and inveterate players should better leave it before better times, because now there is no particular sense. I hope my not very constructive monologue helped with something. Although I originally planned it as just a way to pour out my soul. ",False,False

"So I once more fell into the trap called ""Ubisoft"". I expected this game to be a lot of fun, since I enjoy racing games even if they're as terribly voice acted as the last addition to Need For Speed, but this... this is something else, not just bad Voice acting to rival NFS, but zero to no realism involved, the game clearly isn't directed to a mature audience, you will not be able to drive 10 seconds without jumping over a river, building or bridge... in a GT3RS or a similar car I should mention. About 15 Minutes into the game I got my ""Audi TT RS"" which the game called a ""great sleeper car"" ... in again.. terrible voice-acting. I really tried to like this game but after just 25 Minutes I had to ALT+F4 and issue a Refund for it. There were no guides on how to fly the plane in the Tutorial and you can't look it up in the options since those are blocked off during the tutorial, which made me fly into buildings till I reached the end thanks to resetting my position 10m in front of where I crashed. This is the most perfect game to describe Ubisoft. - Huge World without anything interesting in it - Low Effort put into everything - Made to please Kids ages 9-16 - Stripped of all the logic that could have been implemented In just the first 25 Minutes I jumped over three buildings in a GT3 RS, the narrator called my TT RS a sleeper car and as soon as I got into the first place (which isn't hard at all) everyone behind me gained 300hp and went around corners with 250km/h. Positives : + Good Graphics + Cool Cars + You're allowed to Refund Negatives :  - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Voice-Acting - FAR too easy - Unrealistic Handling - Bland, empty world - For kids (yo cool jump, your social media status just went up bro, more people are following you dude, sick bruh) these are actual lines that are being put in between races all the time, I felt like some ""hypebeast"" was commenting on everything I did... absolutely cringey if you're an adult. - You will most likely refund this game To sum the game up I'd say it's a more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and even less realistic clone of the latest NFS ",False,False

"Play in VR. The impression of Zelda Breath of Wild + Craft Game (close to Forest's multiplayer), with a maximum of 6 people connected, was not in MMO. You can climb any cliff and have a high degree of freedom as an open world. I also have a motorcycle, so it's fun to travel long distances, though I get drunk in VR. I'm having a lot of fun right now, I'm doing it with my friends, but I don't have much information, so I'm groping around, looking around the beautiful scenery, making a base and taking care of the stupid residents. The big drawback is that I can't meet any players other than my friends, I'm doing it publicly, but I've never met anyone. I'm a little lonely because I was expecting a messy MMO. The height of the hurdle is also high. There seems to be nothing that you can't enjoy even in solo play, but I still want someone who can play with me. And since in-game chat is only VC, VC is essential if you want to interact with other people. There are various other drawbacks, but I will omit it because there are too many to write. The bugs at the time of release were terrible, and I've been expecting an innovative VRMMO from the beginning of the game content, so I'd like more people to play with it, but I don't recommend it.

It can only accommodate up to 6 people, so it seems better not to think of it as an MMO. I don't know the details because it will soon be impossible to proceed due to some bug ...

"Fucking shit. More precisely, shit made from xyyni. Or xyynya made of govna. To say that I burned to the ground is to say nothing. The incentive is actually a very specific rating system. In reality, anything that has an overall rating lower than ""very positive"" (ideally ""extremely"" is better) are xye gradations. It is a fact. There will always be a sufficient number of fanboys and just dolboebs putting their thumbs up for, for example, cards. That is, the fact that her reviews were simply ""positive"" - ​​alerted immediately. But I decided to give a chance - like, suddenly everything is really not so bad. Yeah, naxyй. It's just rubbish. Everything is wooden, including the fucking main character and his motives. The plot seemed to be written by a second grader. Although perhaps even he would have written better than the justified rihanna pratchid. Seriously blyad '(uuuuh, cyka, how I hate the fucking steam for this censorship) - fucking Garrett goes to business with a whore, then SOMETHING happens and it turns off and turns on in a year. Where has he been this year? He was rescued by beggars and kept in a safe place. What for? Simple. Just like that blyad. ' Aaaaaaa, yet. Delivering him back to the city, two beggars yebka selflessly sacrificed their lives just to bring him a little closer to home. In the sense - naturally, so that he was not two hundred meters from the house, but at, say, one hundred and fifty - both died with a smile on their lips. Naes. And then it will be so everywhere. The plot is presented approximately with the degree of reliability of the play about Masha and the Bears in the puppet theater. I don’t have enough words to describe the xyeness of all this xyini. I was not surprised when I realized that the role of the main antagonist would be a general with a head in the form of a cheerleader and a movie of the level of Bollywood fighters. Nice is everything. Oxyenno. More from the oxyenny moments. Periodically, it doesn’t jump where it should, for example. Where it is impossible to jump, it doesn’t jump either way. But it dulls also in specially designated places. I went into a tavern. There are several people, in pairs, one at a time - like talking. Only they stand in silence, look at you steadily and periodically move their hands. Quite cryptic xyynya, really. Well, the very performance of such a govna is the same blyad 'level of the 99th year and that, in the game, it was not first class at that time. Everything is super lifeless and dead. The game was really scored xy. And the decanter? What about animations? It's just blyad 'pizdec. Ebony dummies are worse than in the Polish mid-2000s shooter. But this is AAA, fuck him in the mouth, 2014 year naxy. What the hell. Moreover, the decanter of houses-premises-all xyini is generally normal, in places it is even imperceptible that it is ye3. But people blyad '... It's just something. As if straight from the presets of the 3D editor, without finishing. During the day I walked through one level, which, in theory, is designed for a maximum of an hour, and then reluctantly and constantly looking at the video passage - so much in the whole situation shown to me it was even possible to think. Interrogated essentially for some fucking experiment, lol. And, of course, in vain. It was the most boring and xye game I've played in real life in the last three years, if blyad 'not 10, kek. Perhaps she would have competitors, but usually I obviously did drop naxy and it moved either to the shield folder in the incentive or to the trash. And then Chot KILLED. I'm sorry about the time. Super parasha on which the developers simply hammered xy. And this ending ... This is something. I read read about his badness - but I did not expect THIS. Seriously, I just don't have any blyad 'words. Not even the ""super xyita"" nyxyya can describe this ebony. At the moment, this is just the WORST I've seen in games in general. Even the passing products of the 98th year of release, which at one time received 5 points out of 10 from the surveyors, were perhaps better. Wild axy. Naxyy this garbage. It's better to forget about it as soon as possible, otherwise I'm sitting with an elongated ebola and pursed lips from pxyenia. Can't recommend to anyone, never and never. This is super trash.

"The main problem of this game is the joke of the creator studio. The first time I started the game, I realized that it was made for consoles and, as far as I understand, it should have been distributed only to them. How did I get it? ... What is the nxyy console? Am I on Steam or bought the game from MS Store? The game itself has very good potential, but poor implementation. All missions are. How many bullets have to be fired at the enemies so that they die is good news. Of course, I'm not a specialist in defense, but something tells me that even a bullet from a pistol from a distance of a meter, an ordinary helmet will not withstand (and in fact events take place in our time). Most of the plot is told in video fragments ... I don't understand the idea. I could buy a Netflix subscription and watch it dull, but I bought it and finally let it play. Why not make the same episode in the lab playable? I don't mind the concept of a TV series game, but what is it? Why would I give most of the game to shoot stupidly, and watch the other stupidly? How so? Why was it impossible to diversify? Why it was impossible to include the episode with the chase, after all, I got the impression. he meant .... And the worst thing is that the game has really good tech. base. Yes, the optimizer is a buzz, but the graphics would be amazing if the developers did a normal gameplay. How can you explain the fact that there is already soap on the PC through the meter? And after all, if the textures were really good, the resolution would be real (I cannot accept that Full HD in the settings is real Full HD, and not ordinary HD). How could it be ruined by such a crappy optimization? Also, what they bought / made does not tell about pochism. When in the opening scenes something is said that is obviously not relevant to the conversation (I noticed this when I first met the floor. They are talking and there is a truck downstairs). It also turns out something incomprehensible with the position of the sound, when the distance to the voice changes on the go ... I would also like to note a large number of shortcomings. I can't think of any excuses for what the character is. How could this be allowed ??? Also, the character does not know how, as I discovered for myself, to pull up and jump over obstacles (windows). Due to the monotony of tasks, bugs, pictures and optimization, only 1 conclusion can be drawn - the game is raw.

All the Negative post are right in everything they have said I bought this game pre-alpha and it is nothing of its former self. They stripped it of almost everything of potential it had. Now they want you to pay for servers instead allowing you to create your own as it once featured. They made all kinds of excuses and none justify it being removed. This half game is a bait and switch. They should not be allowed to take a game and strip it and replace it with something that does not resemble anything like what was advertised. This is not the Ylands I signed up for. Their meager offerings they gave early buyers don't make up for what they took from us. And then they can't even get that right as I am missing coins from the start. Its like they screwed us and only gave us a tissue to wipe up afterwards. Only if they gave us back what they took will I change my review. ,False,False

"This is one of those great games that just gets hindered by the game developer using old game mechanics and gameplay from older games [Layers of Fear] which not only rip you out of the immersion, but also become more of an annoying headache to sit through than it's actually worth. Observer is great cyberpunk detective game, it feels as though the horror was almost shoved into this game to make it more in the ""horror genre"" whereas instead they should have pursued a more organic psychological thriller theme instead.  The detective work and looking for clues in apartments, as well as uncovering what's really going on in the apartment complex is a real treat. The part that really annoyed me and pushed my limit on playing this game were the points in the game where you find a body or a person and connect into them to see their memories. Then the game stops being Observer and jumps right back into the stale and annoying gameplay of Layers of Fear. Why is stuff floating? Why is everything getting pushed further and further away and always has to have a long pitched squeal attached to it? It goes from a great and interesting detective game into another ""Boo! Spooky Objects!"" game and that really pushed me from enjoying the game into having to sit through monotonous lengths of these ""super spooky"" moments. They drag on and on, your character speed changes and you have to sit through uninteresting and useless information as well as meaningless and borderline incompetent gameplay, either to stretch the longevity of the game further, or to pass it off as a ""super scary game"".  Overall I was disappointed with the game,  I really thought it was going to a detective thriller about a man finding his son and uncovering the mysteries hidden within this apartment complex, but instead I got floating chairs shooting across the room, glitchy people moving across my screen, and loud and repetitive jumpscare noises that not only ruined my immersion, but my enjoyment of the game overall.

"Absolver is a great fighting game with the ability to create your own fighting style. Combining attacks and making the sequence itself is great. Perfectly implemented mechanics of counterattack, absorption, evasion and also cancellation of the attack, which you will not find in many fighting games. Huge fun in the open world, you will almost never be alone, near bosses so sure. More than once it happened that you were fighting the boss for 3 minutes, you almost defeated him, and then a random player flies up, kills you and the boss in addition. And this is not upsetting, because Openworld PVP. But of course, you can cooperate with absolutely any player you meet on your way. The study of new hits occurs by blocking, absorbing or dodging them, and for each action they give their own amount of experience, and besides, you will get experience only when you kill the enemy, otherwise the progress will be reset. But, everything would be fine if not for the servers that are located do not understand where. It is simply impossible to play from Russia and the CIS countries. The game is designed for skill and ping dependence. And if you have a skill, then ping will spoil your nerves. For in PVP you won't even have time to swing, but you will already get 2-3 hits and I'm not even talking about trying to dodge. The verdict is this: Absolver has potential, it has its own style, the game will be designed for skill (because things in the game give both pros and cons, you are either armored but slow, or wadded but fast). Everything is spoiled by ping, which is catastrophically huge. Not recommended for purchase if you are from Russia or CIS countries. Or wait until the servers appear in our region. ",False,False

"A bug Psyconix can't fix. Win 3 - Rank up 1 division Lose 1 - Rank down 1 division Settings reset each time my PC restarts. Gameplay [4/5]: The gameplay for me has been decent but there is various bugs here and then but they don't affect the gameplay too much. The bugs include when the boost counter sometimes dissapears however this does not happen very often. The gameplay is fun and enjoyable without bugs and bad teams. Updates [3/5]: Psyconix updates the game alot (maybe too much) and I personally think they are adding new items too fast e.g. Turbo crates and Nitro crates were both added in under 2 months which is too quick in my opinion. Also, the updates aren't that bad but they have NOT fixed the servers in Asia and Oceania yet and they have been faulty for a long time and haven't yet fixed bugs e.g. hotbar bug, terrible casual matchmaking and more. Matchmaking [2/5]: Once upon a time there was a scrub named 'Timmy.' Timmy was addicted to Rocket League after spending 5000 hours on the game in 1 year. Timmy joins a casual match after a long hard day and joins a game where the score is 6-1. Timmy's reaction is ""oh crunch,"" then he leaves the game and joins another game.

Timmy takes a sneaky peek of the score and it is 2-5 to his team. Timmy decides that he wants a fair matchmaking game so he leaves the game. Timmy gets some milk and comes back. He carefully sips up the milk and decides to join ANOTHER GAME. 4th game now and Timmy is getting a bit triggered. He joins a game and it ends as he joins. He then gets angry and screams ""AHHHHHHHH."" Timmy looks for another game. Timmy joins another game. When he joins the game everything is fine and he decides to say ""hello"" in chat. xX_Shrek420_Xx replied ""♥♥♥♥ you get deported ♥♥♥."" Timmy replies ""reported,"" xX_Shrek420_Xx replies ""that's it I am selling your IP on eBay."" (His IP later was sold for 0.99$ on eBay. Timmy, at this point, has contracted crippling depression and various other STD's. Timmy tries one more time to join a casual match. His router fried and his house burnt down. The end?

Good times for those who spent hours away from home in a bar playing arcade games with friends from the street or from school! All that nostalgia for you to face fighters against the CPU and the 4 great final bosses (Balrog, Vega, Sagat and lastly, Bison!) And to see each fighter's own ending, was lost in that fifth title with the absence of! The great boldness of wanting to innovate, did not work and did not please traditional and casual fans! Why do I say that? Simple! Because many who were boys at the time and had the life of a tramp to spend all the time playing, nowadays they are workers! And because of that, the lack of a mode against the CPU makes all the difference for those who were already used to it! It was practically an improved workout before going to the versus or ranked competitions! Because of this, casual gameplay has been left completely aside, forcing the player to always be able to enjoy more features of it! It's the  ? Ah! The story mode ... Well, I say it was no big deal! Neither engaging nor exciting! Weak plot that looked like a sloppy mixed salad! He was confused and ended up not focusing on the history and the true essence of each fighter! He looked more like a ""Street Fighter"" style than the old man of the Great Street Fighters in search of fame and glory that we once knew! Exaggeration to talk like that? Not! It is not an exaggeration! That's because I didn't mention that in addition to not having a Versus CPU Mode, Arcade Mode and practically forcing you to stay online all the time for a bigger experience, as if that weren't enough, there are several customs (DLCs of fighter clothes) that can only be obtained by buying with real money that cost a stab! So you who should be reading must be asking yourself: So is the game horrible? Not! It is not! The graphic and visual part of the fighters and special moves is impeccable! Very beautiful! Really jaw-dropping! I must add that the levels are very well done, however, you should take better advantage of placing elements in 3D where as the combat was going on and breaking things! It would be sensational and very welcome for this New Generation of Games! There are other ways like "",, and the! My final assessment: The Game is not horrible, but it is far from the best in the Franchise! Unfortunately, there are a lot of"" ""than"" to be found in the Game! Perhaps the biggest disappointment was ""being too mercenary and there is no"" (It always has been and will always be the best game mode in, in my opinion)! As a big and passionate fan, it is with great regret that my analysis of this game is negative! Perhaps if you put Arcade Mode and combat versus CPU together with future updates that complete the game, I can review my concept! For now, I do not recommend buying! ",False,False

Except for certain characters, the likelihood is automatically increased after the beginning (which is solved by gifting that specific character as well), and there is a delay even though you have to keep talking, so the only benefit of clicking is when the second character clicks the dialogue.

You essentially are in an arena and numbers spawn in the arena, you must spay the numbers with your water gun to solve the equations that pop up overhead. That’s it. If you simply do the “static” problems that appear overhead then the game ends after a certain amount. If you go and do the dynamic ones then you can keep playing, but it gets dull rather quickly. This is not simply myself, as I had someone more age appropriate for the game play as well and they didn’t play nearly as long as I had. The water gun to spray the numbers is an interesting idea, but the problem is that its a water gun that keeps spraying if you shoot, up until it shoots a number. The continuous fire, and the fact that when it fires, it shoots in an arc, means you will likely be miss firing quite a lot at the numbers. The game has this interesting feature of a dog on a flying hoverboard that points out numbers if you take too long, but with the numbers flying everywhere you will have to practically dive for them if you want to be faster than the dog. If the dog points out the number, it doesn’t seem to affect anything. Overall, if you spend some time within the level, it looks like theres too much going on and not enough at once, since there are numbers and idle animations from objects and other things around, but aside from the numbers, there really is not a whole lot of things to do. The game itself also does seem like a stripped down version of the original, as there is only addition, in double and single digits, where the original based on screenshots seems to have all 4 operations, decimals and other things of the sort. There are quite some areas where the game is just a glitchy mess, if you go jumping around you may get stuck under the pier on the beach, jump through the roof on the tiki huts, and so on.  The game itself looks very basic, and a tad bland. There are 3 different maps, originally 2 when I first played it, but all somewhat different, but they do seem to recycle textures a bit. The people in the beach level appear in the sediment level with rocks on their head, and some of the rocks looks like theyre on both the moon level and sediment level. Kids may not mind the aesthetic, but the one that played this did comment about this, though he was not as kind to call it bland. The game also has this constant track that feels very kiddish and repetitive. Overall despite having an interesting concept for kids to learn, I do not see kids staying entertained for very long if at all on this game, not just because of the above, but because kids generally do not find these types of games entertaining. Having grown up playing bad flash games while in school, on “coolmathgames”, we always played the games least like math, and games that did not have us “learning”, or we just had two tabs open and switched back and forth whenever the teacher came by.

"The game had two glowing positive reviews and no negative reviews when I wrote this. I didn't want to write a one line review, but I thought people should know that the game is really awful!  Yeah, it's incomplete and I'll never finish it. It was at something like 3 helpful and 15 unhelpful in the first week.  So many homers, hah. _________________________________________________________ I find my ship doing 270's when it could just turn 90 degrees and move.  I also couldn't figure out how to stay in one spot and turn the ship around, though I suspect I was a bit dim in that aspect, assuming it's that left and right arrow at the bottom left of the screen.  Regardless, the first tutorial mission should have at least mentioned what these buttons do. I gave up after failing about ten times on the second 'tutorial' mission.  I'll try again later (and delete and update this review). essentially; you may want to wait for more reviews to come in before spending that $20. ed: a bit more before I start playing again... was giving this some thought and it appears to me that this is probably more akin to the puzzle genre of games rather than a tactical simulation.   You have to find the proper position to put your ship & have it be turned the right direction so that your (sometimes bizarre) weapon arcs will be able to hit the enemy ships.  I've never had such trouble firing at something right in front of me, lol. & a major flaw that I hadn't thought of earlier... there is no opportunity fire.  Rather major thing to lack for a tactical space battle game, I'd think.   See that ship that didn't move last turn?  Well, fear not, because you can still go right past it w/ no issue.  Once your turn ends, it's bedtime.  CLEAR THE BRIDGE! ",False,False

"is a short/medium length (it really depends on how fast you read and if you wait for the characters to finish all their lines) otome visual novel. There are  ; each route has   (they are very short though) and there are  : a happy and a normal ending. When you reach the normal ending, you'll see it in chapter 15 itself. But if you gather all the points necessary during your choices, you'll get to read an extra chapter, the ""happy ending"" one.   There are   in this visual novel, though. It was published by   on Steam and developed by another company,  . You play as a young girl called Amane Kosaka (you can change her name). She lives in the countryside, until one day her brother orders that she must move to the central city of the Empire (he's the current ruler). Amane is a sort of ""cookie cutter"" otome heroine: she's young, inexperienced, naive, doesn't think too much of herself, etc. It can be hard to relate to someone like her at times, but that's fine. It would be a lot better if she was a bit more independent or just stood out for herself. She could be really worse, though. Anyway, let's talk a bit about the guys and their routes.  , the serious bodyguard, was my first choice. He's the quiet type, and his route was... okay? I mean, nothing much happens. It's very straightforward, and suddenly the story reaches its climax.  , the playboy and café owner, wasn't my favorite character, but his route was my favorite. I'm not into the ""flirty"" type in otome VNs, but Tanba was a sweet man. And I actually liked his route, it was more interesting than the other guys' stories since it happened outside the castle.  , the captive prince and private tutor, is very handsome. But... is it me or does he also have a very punchable face? I'm dead serious. Anyway, I liked his backstory, it was sad. But his route was also rushed, and he changes his behavior towards Amane too fast.  , the childhood friend, was... alright. He's even sweeter than Tanba. But his route was  , oh my god. I fell asleep twice, I'm not kidding. It was cute, sure, but just... boring. I'm sorry. And finally, we have Amane's brother,  , the cold emperor. His route was like a rollercoaster, it starts fine, and then suddenly   and things just go downhill from there. And then they change again? I don't know, it was very confusing and rushed. Not that I was expecting much dept, but some coherence would've been nice.  . I'm usually a fast reader, but it took me a bit more of time to read through this VN since I fell asleep during Kagemitsu's route. Which is really a shame, the art and VA are great here. But the story wasn't.  The art style is good, and the guys are overall handsome. There is awkward anatomy in a few CGs though like really big hands, small heads, etc. It didn't bother me so much, but I'm not sure about other people. The BGM is nice as well, it's not a masterpiece, but it's pleasant. My only complaint about the UI of this game is the fact that the auto button isn't really for automatic text, it's to skip read text. The highlight of TCE is definitely the VA: the voice actors did an amazing job! Actually, the whole game has VA, not just the romanceable guys. The protagonist is the only silent character. I mean, it's great that we get such good VA, but in the end, if the story is just boring, I don't think it's much worth it. It took me 11 hours to complete all routes, reading at a slow pace. Mostly because like I've said before, the game is tedious and I fell asleep.  5/10. In the end, I don't recommend  . Yes, it's visually appealing and the VA is great, but... It's   expensive for such a boring game. I can only recommend this VN when it's heavily discounted or bundled AND if you're really curious about it. There are better and cheaper otome games out there, and even for free. But that's just my opinion. ",False,False

"An awful Garry's Mod clone. The bad case of trying to copy-paste the Gmod interface and gameplay, but in UE4 and absolutely with no content. You'll not get any new features, physical innovations or something. You also aren't getting all basical stuff and features that Garry's Mod includes. There are just a couple of basic props, vehicles and NPC's with pretty bad animations and AI. It's pretty far even from the basic Gmod without mods. This game is poor alpha at fact, as if another guy wants to tell us ""Hey look, how beautiful Gmod could be"". But after all this is on the release state. Do not waste your money for another ""UE4 features demonstration"". It doesn't worth even 3$, it should be in closed alpha test or free to play. But not the finished product. ",False,False
"After enjoying the first game, my friend and I played this one. All around, this one is a disappointment in comparison. While none of the puzzles are too difficult to figure out, you will die on many of them several times before you can successfully complete them. Each time you die, the game takes a long time to reload, or fails to load entirely. As a result, we had to quit and restart in order to try again. Most disappointing, is that in order to get the best ending, you have to flip a number of switches throughout the game. If you quit the game at any time, your progress with these switches is not saved. This means, if you want the best ending, you have to complete the game in one sitting. The devs could have easily addressed this, but didn't. That seems to be the main failing in my opinion. With more care and attention this could have been a much better game. I would definitely recommend the first game, which is free, instead of this one. ",False,False
"This game is meant to be played by those who have completed (and liked) the original  . That's why it makes me wonder why most of the main story is just a repetition of things told in the main game. We already know what happened and how it ended. There is no mystery in that. Of course, there are some additions to the story - a couple of additional characters and more detailed description of events taking place. However, it all feels like filler content. The two new characters are just dumb and feel out of the place. The new chapters are not inspiring and sometimes feel useless and unneeded. At least, this story ends with some new insight, which is satisfying. But to get to that, I needed to endure all the things before. The original game was tragic, beautiful and poetic, and this one is mundane, straightforward and dull. Even the language is changed to the worse. Now it's too simplistic and slangy. I do understand that it's justified by the characters being the lower class and living in the slums, but it draws attention by being so much different from the original. Aside from the main story, there are a few little episodes, featuring different characters from the main game. Those episodes feel definitely closer to the original. I think it could be the stories created for the original game, which were cut for some reason. One of them though (Happily Ever After) is different and adds the new events to the ending of the main game, however it's unneeded fillers once again. The longest among extra episodes is ""Backstage"". I didn't like it in the original, and this time it's extra huge, but still weird and even more boring. It makes me sad to give this game a negative review, especially after taking liking to the original one. However, out of ~17 hours that I have logged in this game, only 2-3 were actually good: the very ending of the main story and maybe some of the sub episodes. Everything else is just repetition and fillers. ",False,False

"This game is actually quite famous, but not for its gameplay, rather the accident it indirectly caused - Bad Aibling rail accident. Copied from wikipedia: ""Prosecution says that the dispatcher causing the Bad Aibling rail accident, leaving 12 people dead and 89 injured, played Dungeon Hunter 5 on his smartphone during work."" As for the game itself, it is seriously offputting by the amount of buttons and main menu screen options. It tries to teach you mechanics and various gameplay elements step by step, making them locked at first, however in return it makes for a very, very lengthy tutorial and its very hard for me to pay much attention to it considering so many mobile RPGs are unnecessarily convoluted. I'd prefer to check its options from start, to see if it has any unique mechanics or game modes(which it doesnt seem to have), rather than play dozens of uninspired single player missions with uninspired story. Combat is kind of okay, feels a bit responsive considering what it is, but its still a mobile game ported to PC, which leaves for so much more to be desired. ",False,False
"I didn't want to apply a thumbs-down because this is a game that achieves a fair bit of what it set out to do, and is obviously a labour of love. Nice day/night changes, a peaceful feel to it, a chance to listen to MP3s in a fairly stress-free game, comfortable controls. It took me a while to get it set up, but I was soon chugging up hills at 15 mph. I think my main disappointment was to do with expectations. The blurb says: ""dozens of cities to explore"". I didn't expect 1-to-1 fidelity, but to me, explore means at least they would feel like cities, and be vaguely recognisable. Much as I'd have loved it to be like driving through Google Street View, I had already scaled back my expectations. I assumed maybe cities would only have a third of the roads, something like that. I wasn't prepared for reaching Cardiff, a city I know well, and discovering that it seemed to be two roads and a depot. Likewise with Swansea. Ouch. I'd persuaded my girlfriend that we might be able to drive from our hometown across Wales, then on to Europe, and eventually down the coast of Italy, perhaps finding the town where some of our family live. Wrong. The vast majority of places in each country are missing. A few cities will exists as just a couple of roads, nothing like what you'd expect from Saints Row/GTA/Sleeping Dogs. Don't get me wrong, that would be great but I understand why things have been scaled down - I just think it's deceptive not to make that clear from the sales blurb. If that had stated that there were 40 urban areas out of the many thousands, and that cities were scaled down 1,000 times, and that places with populations of below a million weren't included, I'd have at least had an idea of how far the game is from reality. For example, the UK alone has 69 cities (and many thousands of towns and villages) but ETS2 only has 18, each of which is a few roads. Cities mainly act as just blobs on a map, connecting points. A grand tour of Europe this is not - it's a patchwork quilt edged by invisible walls (well, you can see them, big Xs and chevrons floating in the air to stop you heading towards landmarks or B-roads or anything that isn't a motorway). The map of Italy seemed to cut off at the very edge - so technically Italy is included, but only as a few clumps of road in a teeny area. It seems disingenuous. Most European countries don't seem to be in the game. This is a disappointment only because of the misleading advertising. It seems you can listen to radio stations in game but I never got that to work, no matter how many URLs I added to a text document nested far down my hard drive hierarchy. No error messages - good luck if you aren't IT literate. Finally, I think I'd have got a bit more pleasure from it if I could have also had the option of driving around in a car rather than a truck. It's weird that the game simulates many things; as a company owner you probably have a car, but there is no option to go anywhere in it. I'd have thought a free drive mode would have been a nice addition for people like me, who don't want a racing game, just something more sedate, but the chance to explore the small part of Europe that has been included at a bit more of a zippy pace. Still, that's a suggestion, not a criticism. The main feeling I had was one of disappointment at the scale of the game. It may be hundreds of miles wide, but the detail is only inches deep, a surface impression that didn't really satisfy me. I can see why others might be happy with it. Maybe a more accurate blurb would have helped, rather than trying to sell the Earth. --- I can't comment on my own review's comments thread due to some error (thanks Steam), so here's my response to the comment by HaddockA, who said ""You're seriously crazy to even think that such a game in 2016 could even exist... That's like having GTA V multiplied by a factor of 1,000.... you're seriously weird. ."" My reply: ""I probably am crazy but that's a separate issue. Having never played one of these games, but having used the free Google Street view which lets you do something similar, I don't see why it was crazy to imagine the game would map 33% of the roads, rather than 0.01% (or whatever the figure is). After all, it says ""cities to explore"". But you get there and there is nothing to explore. Just a few roads, one supermarket with an empty car park, and a background view you can't reach. If the blurb included what % of Europe's roads were included in the game then I'd be a fool to expect otherwise, but they don't include that information, thereby inviting inflated expectations.""

"Steam really needs to add ""Neutral"" mark cause this game deserves ""Neutral"" more than ""Negative"". One thing for sure, not deserved ""Positive"" review as there are many problems with this game.  Cons: There is one neutral point:  This is neutral because from the very first hours of game it is already easy to tell who is bad guy, who is the future traitor, who is going to die, who doesn't like Lara aaanndd so on, so  . In other way, if you search for documents with their background stories they get at least a bit interesting, still not that much to become a positive point. Now onto a few pros: So after these many negative points you may start thinking why the heck I still want a ""Neutral"" point for this game. The answer is:  , for the first playthrough this game is very nice. The problem is, the more you play it the more negative points you start to recognize.  So if you haven't played it, do it just to get the story before heading to next parts of franchise. If you want to buy it, do it but with decent discount, not worthy for full price. ",False,False

It's a short gamne with a few achievements that is quite easy to get, once you understand and learn the controls. The levels are nicely designed but gets repetitive from time to time.

"Far Cry only has the name and nostalgia. Well, right now, I think at a high level of difficulty, I will be a month on all fours of the sectarians in the field with a shovel while I pump the Persian, but no fucking high level of difficulty is when enemies hit with a 90% probability and do twice as much damage than on medium difficulty. In the prologue at a high level of difficulty, they killed me in the car, I tried for about an hour ... there is no trace of balance. And the pumping itself is strange, catch fish, kill all the living creatures that you meet, collect magazines. It seems that the game was forcibly sharpened in a coop, shooting a curve, treatment for half an hour and mobs that spawn in tons, mobs are stupid but their stupidity compensates for the curves of hit boxes or a huge amount of health, for example, a Vip sectarian (a dude in trousers with a naked torso without armor at all) withstands a clip from a machine gun to the head, and he puts you with 2-4 shots, I manal such gameplay. Maybe it's interesting in the COOP. Controlling the plane on the keyboard cheto with something, I had to cut the joystick. Quests are monotonous and dreary bring kill give go fuck you don't bother.

The game has costumes and donations, is there anyone who will buy costumes for donations in the game that they have already bought for the full price list?

"SR4 is an unstable mess. In less than 30 minutes, the game has locked up twice. Everything just freezes & forces me to log out of Windows just to regain control of my OS. When I did a search on the forums, I was greeted with pages upon pages of this being experienced by users as far back as 2014. To this point in time, I have not located a remedy, but the search continues. How does a AAA game, that's been out for this long, go without a patch from the developer? Answer - neglect. ------------------------------------------------- Update - After some searching I came across an article that seems to have resolved the stability issues. I followed the 1st few steps & was able to play, uninterrupted for 4.5 hours. I'm not going to post a link, just google, ""5 Ways to Fix Saints Row 4 Crashes - wikiHow"". As far as recommending the game goes, I'm still a ""No"". I'm not totally against the game because it's the continuation of a great series. The story is still one that is fun to follow, but the mechanics detract from what made the game great in the 1st place. 1) The super powers make vehicles & vehicle customization obsolete. & the worst part about it, is the game starts dumping these powers into your lap, right out of the gate. Once out of the scripted opening sequences, I stole 1 car to get from point A to B. I was then granted my 1st powers & have had zero use for a car since. 2) Again my problem is with these powers. Part of the fun of SR is overcoming the early struggle & building yourself up to being an ultimate badass. While I appreciate a developer who made an attempt at not erasing the player's past achievement. I feel like Volition went too far way too early. 3) I understand the thought process behind this decision, but it's disorienting & kicks immersion in the gonads. The radio constantly plays. When you get in a car, the radio kicks on. When you get out of a car, the radio stays on. When the car you got out of is on the west coast & you are on the east coast, you still hear that same damn radio. You have to manually turn the crap off. I get that nobody would ever hear the radio if this wasn't implemented. I also understand that there are settings to help with this, but I prefer the old way & there are no settings for 2or3 style radio. The way to correct the immersion is to either shut music off completely or buy some headphones from a clothing store so there is a logical audio source. 4) This has more of a platformer & less of an open world feel. I'm not against platformers, in general. It's like when you pick up a cup of what you thought was soda but you forgot you poured iced tea. Neither are bad, it's just that the expectation was off enough that it left a bad taste in your mouth. In short, 'I'll play SR4, I don't hate it, but it's not up to par with the SR lineage.' ------------------------------------------- The more of this I play, the more I hate the game. SR4 is an absolute masterclass in how to destroy a franchise. As the game dumps more side missions in your lap, the fun is drained from the game. A lot of the side missions are tedious & irritating & to top it all off just completing them isn't enough. There's a medal system Volition seems to think you want to deal with. At this point I honestly don't know if I'm going to subject myself to much more of this. Gaming is supposed to be a fun pass time. This game feels more like a weight on my back. ",False,False

"I'm generally a fan of twin-stick shooters but I guess I'm just not hardcore enough for TxP. Great style and personality, but too much of this game bothered the hell out of me. In an hour or so of play time I went through about 50 runs and I don't think I'll be coming back to it, other than idling for card drops. I have no idea why people are comparing this to Devil Daggers. Other than both games taking place in a single arena, they are nothing alike. A more obvious comparison is the   series. TxP is basically a better-looking, more chaotic version of those games minus the melee component. I like that the heroine in TxP curses up a storm through the entire game, being a big fan of profanity myself (I'd love to see a video of the recording session), but there's not a lot of variety there. She just says f**k a lot, like one of the South Park kids after they snuck in to the Terrance and Phillip movie. More creativity would have been nice. The gameplay is where I have the biggest problems though. Number one on the list: You can't pause this game. And if you should instinctively tap the Start button at some point, as I did twice, the game will immediately quit to the main menu. I don't care if that's an engine limitation or a design decision, it's idiotic. So hopefully you won't ever be having a good run and suddenly have to scratch your nose or answer the doorbell. My personal best run came on my 5th attempt, with a score of 75,000. Through my next 40-plus runs, I didn't came close to that again. I never felt that I was getting better as I played more, even after stopping half-way through to read the   that Andrei wrote. There is so much noise and distraction while you're playing that it's very difficult to see attacks and bullets before they've already killed you (one hit deaths). This gets even worse when the bosses start appearing, as debris and other hazards start dropping from the ceiling and flying in all directions. Luck seems to play a bigger role in survival the deeper into the game you get - too much for me. ",False,False

"The Anti-Kinets Foundation presents: Backward characters, hackneyed morals, even more money from fans - the secret empire of Telltale Games. What is the third season about? Yes, not about anything, to be honest. Understand, I really love the post-apocalypse theme, I love stories about people who survive in a long-dead world. TWD is one worthy example of this kind of story. I really like the original comic strip and how much I fell in love with the first season, how much I remember its heroes and even the continuation that sags openly in places is also dear to my heart. In the first part of the TTG, they told the story of Lee, a man who was forced to survive in a harsh world full of zombies and protect the little girl Clem. We all fell in love with these heroes, empathized with them and cried over deaths. Then came the second season, which brought slightly weaker characters, but it was still an interesting, fascinating journey through a dead land, with its motley characters, where you love some with all your soul, and others you wish a speedy death. In addition, the second season was a continuation of the story of Clementine, the same girl who took us through the first five episodes ... The third season, even during its announcement, claimed that it would show us completely new characters that would be important for the series. And in the end, we get characters so caricatured, stupid and doing absolute bullshit (hello Gabe!) That you just want to get rid of them as soon as possible, you want it to turn out to be a bad dream and we see the characters dear to our hearts again, but no .. After quite an interesting introduction, where only Gabe pisses me off (he really is down, it's not for nothing that his father told him that ""son, keep your opinion to yourself until you learn to realize what is happening""), absolutely everyone starts to open up and do nonsense. The degree of absurdity, ala the armored car hood lit up by Molotov, grows faster with every minute of subsequent episodes than a whore flies from the 13th floor (yes, a joke, repeated dvzhady becomes even funnier). The new Xavi and the good old Clem look more or less adequate against the background of everything that is happening. Almost all the action of the season takes place in one place. And if in the first minutes there is still some kind of intrigue, interest in what happened to A.J., then everything is quickly forgotten. Take a bite, players! You will spend all your time in Richmond, a city that is completely uninteresting to you, but you will have to decide its fate. And okay, if only it was interesting, but the developers did everything so primitively that half of the plot moves are immediately guessed, and the rest they will spoil in the trailers for the episodes. Yes, TTG grew up in directing, but at the same time they forgot that this is a game. Yes, TTG tightened the picture and it looks more mature, but apart from it there is nothing in the ""new frontier"". Fewer walking in, even QTE is almost nonexistent. But there are long, boring dialogues. There are drawn-out scenes with characters doing such fierce game that you want to turn off the game. More and more illogical, not as non-explanatory moments. Yes, TTG still cleverly manages the illusion of choice in its creation, but just don't feel like choosing. In most of the moments that ""influence"" the plot, you just poke the first option you like, and not the one that interests you and will lead to better, in your opinion, consequences. Why is this happening? Because, again, I don't care. I don't care if this character dies, because he was either an idiot or a gray dummy anyway. I don't give a damn that a whole city or just two people would die, because if it were in reality and if real people were the same morons, you would simply choose to dump away from the idiotic city that destroyed itself, and from these downs who do not understand what they are do. Spit. Spit. And once again, do not care about everything that happens on the screen. The only interesting storyline is tied to Clem and the child, but even that is pulled until the end of the game, and then, without revealing, they spit in the players' faces, in plain text hinting that you will bring us more money in a couple of years if you are interested in this storyline, because that the fourth season will be ... But we just don't need the fourth season, TTG, we just need the ending of this long story. Don't torture the players, don't torture poor Clem. Kill her like you killed TWD Season 3. Let her go to Lee and there they will be happy. As a result, we have the weakest storyline, and I remind you that only the plot can give us the game, because there is no more gameplay here at all, part of TWD, and indeed the game of all that this studio did. An empty, unnecessary story about a family that ruined itself due to the fact that all its members are completely narcissistic, empty-headed, hysterical people. ",False,False

"Like many others, I was at awe with the praise Night in the Woods has gotten, so going into the game, I had high hopes. But now when I've played through the game, I can't help feeling disappointed. I am not entirely sure if I just had the wrong impression of what the game would be, but the experience I have had with the game has felt lackluster, and I am saying that after giving the game two full playthroughs, and a third one under way as of writing this review. One of the biggest issues I have with the game is that the main narrative more often than not takes a backseat to mundane side activities. At times, I felt captivated by the story, but I quickly got caught up in other tasks and a predictable routine. It actually makes me a bit sad, because I think that it could have been so much more interesting and intense, had the focus been shifted to fleshing out the story. The last act was probably the most disappointing part of the story overall, as it left you without any sort of closure. Another thing that was bugging me was that the story is not driven forward by interaction, making it feel like the game would have been better off as a visual or regular novel; it is not a platformer, as some people have suggested. The interactivity only really comes in during the mini games, which in my opinion, are the worst part of the game; they feel unfinished, with clunky controls and frustrating mechanics. Even after my frustration with parts of the game, there are some elements that I genuinely enjoyed. Some, if not most, of the characters are very well-written, with distinct personalities and drives, and they have given me a handful of laughs. The situations the characters find themselves in are creative and memorable, and the art direction and sound design are both a treat. However, the negatives sadly outshine the positives in this instant, and I personally would not recommend this game. ",False,False

"Fallout 4, is a stylized RPG shooter with modern graphics. The plot is completely devoid of logic in what is happening. This is especially true of the Brotherhood of Steel, which is constantly collecting pieces of technology from the old world, and here decides to destroy the super-technological base of the institute. Why? Maybe Todd Howard knows, though hardly. Dialogues (if they can be called so): - yes (we take the task); - no (listen to the remark, return to ""yes""); - SARCASM (listen to another line, return to ""yes""). Dialogues do not solve anything, and no matter what you choose, the result will always be the same. ""Very interesting homeless simulator"", a task that seems to be impossible to perform, but every time new ""save someone from someone"" come and then hang in the list of tasks as active, which is just annoying, if you do it, you will be asked to look for glue and and build a cot in your village, because newcomers have nowhere to sleep. After that, your settlement equipped with machine guns will be attacked by three gules, and you need to come and save everyone. Very interesting game, though (no).

Over and over you will replay each level, which will be extremely tedious. The game itself is both simple and difficult. The level can be passed in several ways: by filling everyone in a row at the level from your weapon, which, by the way, is being upgraded, or by carefully bypassing everyone and getting to your final victim - the number of bonuses that are awarded for passing will depend on this.

"In short, I started to write a positive review, but then I played the game longer. From the pros: new things there (mega-constructions, economy, market), a new interesting system of priests, a new system of resources, borders, etc. Of the minuses - the implementation of all this SHIT. Butts grow - super long. If you do not stack a billion modifiers, then the gain will be even a little SLOWER than in previous versions. And this is taking into account the fact that to unlock all buildings on the planet you need 75 priests, and if this is the capital, then 80. The new interface sucks. Removing the hotkey from the technology window, pushing it into the planner of an expedition or a fleet in a game where it is more expensive to fight and expand because of poor micromanagement and administrative limits - brilliantly, kill yourself. The entire top panel is now occupied by new resources, icons of technologies and other things - on the side. The icons are so small that you have to recognize them by their outlines. The interface is not informative. The game has a TON of micromanagement, much more than it was before, And you don't even write the requirements for buildings sane! The laboratory of the second level requires not 4 units of energy and 1 unit of gas, but 4 units of energy and 50 units of minerals, because that is how much is used to create gas and work for scientists! Why doesn't it fucking show? Because of this, the economy jumps and spins like a port prostitute on a pole, dick understand what, kavo, when and how to fix it. Today +200 energy, after 2 game years - -140, by the way, this is no exaggeration. Add to this the fact that some types of resources are now produced from others, and at what prices - you will not be shown, look for yourself! Administrative limit: it would be fucking awesome if there were no 13 (!) Systems WITHOUT PLANETS and counting areas, and with areas on ONE system, God forbid. Exceeding will result in penalties, which are insignificant at first, but grow exponentially. Because of this, the AI ​​never fights. It doesn't do anything at all, doesn't even expand or build fleets. As a result: MICROMANAGED HELL, they didn't even try to do better - they went fucking crazy, they are fucking sick, gone.

"The game is so interesting that I can't bring myself to go through the final, for 5 months now, almost everything is bad in it, but more on that later. To begin with, I will say that RPG is my favorite genre, and given that there are few real RPGs in terms of role-playing games, I am often prejudiced towards them, which will not happen with Pilars, I can forgive RPG graphics, bugs, maybe combat, partly the plot if he not just terrible and there are many interesting additional quests and other pluses, the problem is that Pillars of Eternity cannot boast of anything from this list. just a nightmare, it is not turn-based but in real time but with a pause. And if you do not realize all the shitty of this system, then I will explain that you will have to just zadrachit the gap that activates the pause and give orders from there, you also just can't control anything, the heroes themselves will run and disperse, crowd in narrow corridors. It was painfully unpleasant for me to see my paladin standing somewhere behind the shooters while they were being gnawed. Yes, someone can say about the construction and behavior, but ... THEY BITCH NICK DOES NOT HELP FUCK! You can put at least as Oni heroes. Does not matter . To contrive. Get stuck. And the behavior of the heroes is just shit, since the battles are different and always need to be conducted in different ways, especially with certain behaviors, unnecessary abilities may be used. In general, nonsense, if without spoilers, then we begin to see souls and in the Dyrwood region where the events of the game take place, children are born without souls and this is kind of bad. To be honest, I can't why I should care deeply about this backwater, these are not the Aedir Republics, in the place of the hero I would have tumbled into a tavern to drink and then dumped to hell. Oh, and even throughout the entire passage you will be fucked up with the words ""Animation and Builders"". In general, the plot is shit, for example, the same Fallout New Vegas from just the same Obsdians are discussed even after 10 years, have you heard that they would discuss whether Animation is harmful ??? Here I am not. For a party game, companions are an important element of a march not in this one, not well, seriously, who do we have? A black woman with feathers on her head and she's a paladin ??! A priest calling his goddess a whore? An Elf with a Biopolar O4? Of all this rabble, only Cana deserves respect. It would be better if they weren't. Really .

"Well this was underwhelming and disappointing. Not that I expected something outstanding, but the game looked quite enticing at first glance. It has excellent visuals and is a 18+ otome, which is so rare that attracts attention. After playing the game, I can say gorgeous visuals are the only thing it has going for it. I had more fun captioning and commenting my screenshots than actually playing it. Story is the weakest part, world building non-existent. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t expect some deep elaborate story, but at least something more engaging. The plot is fairly simple, when you strip it down, but it looks convoluted by confusing and boring magic technobabble. Yes, that’s right, this game makes magic boring. I don’t know if it’s full of plot holes, probably. I was long dead from boredom to pay attention to such details. It is also repetitive. There is no variation in the two route story/plot wise. Everything happens in the same way, just with a different guy as a bystander. This is not the problem of translation. The language itself is easy to follow and more or less natural (to my ears). There are some grammatical errors but nothing that would make it hard to read. The problem is deeper, the writing itself. This visual novel attempts to incorporate adventure/puzzle gameplay into it’s structure, which is interesting, I guess. It feels more like HOG in that aspect (although hidden object scenes are more challenging) You have a few scenes where you ‘perform’ a ritual, but that’s actually just clicking on hotspots. You may or may not listen to her technobabble (thank god, ugh) So this puzzle gameplay is severely watered down and doesn’t really make the game more engaging, only more buggy.   So ok, it’s not a good story (or puzzle game), but who cares, it’s a 18+ otome. Surely I can enjoy it as a trashy romance novel at least. I wish! When the story and especially world building are weak then characters don’t have the ground to stand on resulting in pretty thin characterisation and consequently romance. Although I’ve known quite a few fictional works with so-so  stories but interesting and engaging characters. That’s not the case here. I don’t even have much to say about them. Generic western MC: likes to technobabble and info dump..........has nice bo*obs. Two love interests are supposed to be polar opposites. Shanrae, the Druid, the half-naked flowerboy is sort of naive, nice, young..........has a six-pack. Can’t quite think of more. He’s definitely a more striking eye-candy, abs on display and all. Seth, the Necromancer, is more interesting, but very tropey. He’s confident, cocky, blunt. The most entertaining thing in the whole game are his drunken rants. It’s like the writer had limited access to personality clay and used it all on Seth, forgetting to leave some for Shanrae.  With a story and characters like these it’s no wonder that romance suffers. It’s very rushed and unconvincing, there’s barely any tension. It follows the same pattern for both guys:  So ok, it’s not a good story (or puzzle game) or romance, but who cares, it has sex, in otome. All those other things are just a setting, an excuse for smut anyway, right? Wrong! I’ve read way better smut in fanfiction. But ff has the benefit of already established characters and worlds, all of which are sorely lacking here. Here, the smut is mechanical, bland, unexciting, especially in Shanrae’s route. It’s not even especially bad so that I can at least laugh (like in Dogenzaka games) It’s just..... It’s a bit better in Seth’s route just because he’s more interesting anyway and there’s some tension in the romantic scene building up to it. But then it just goes into SM territory out of the blue.  So ok, who cares (actually at this point, everyone), it looks absolutely gorgeous. Yes that’s right, visuals are top-notch, from backgrounds and attractive sprites to amazing cgs full of vibrant colours. Sprites are also moving and have animated faces, especially eyes. Although the latter can be quite hilarious in the way rolling eyes makes them look doll-like.  Seth especially was rolling his eyes so hard he probably saw his brain. Music is ok too with some memorable tracks and goes nicely with the visuals. Ok that’s enough for positives. Sadly! There’s one more negative thing that can be a problem for a lot of people. The game is buggy. Maybe less than before, but I encountered unresponsive or laggy mouse click especially in puzzle scenes and after skipping. Also there were sometimes long black outs between scenes. Steam overlay doesn’t work so you can’t take screenshots through steam client. Achievements still don’t work. Usually the lack of achievements and trading cards doesn’t influence the way I rate the game. But here, that’s one more thing to add on the pile of things that should be working, but don’t. Maybe if the game worked smoothly it would be easier for some to overlook other shortcomings, especially on a good discount. : there's 3   - visuals, music, Seth's drunken rants...ok and Shanrae’s chest and abs (I’m feeling generous); and a lot of   with greater weight - story and plot, world building, characters, romance, smut, no achievements where they should be, no steam overlay, buggy. You do the math. Also that saying ‘all flash no substance’ (which is often misused) can be correctly applied here. I know we are starved for good adult otome, but that doesn’t mean we have to settle for poorly written romance and smut.

"Long, empty, boring. That's how I would define this game. It's a bit nasty but that's what I felt during this long journey of 13h ... So it's a puzzle game and others puzzles which you have to understand yourself the functioning a bit like Talos Principle (in my opinion the best of its kind). Except that there we are released in a large map, furry, lost in the pampas. The only thing you can do in this strange place is ... puzzles. YEAH TOO GOOD! No in real life, it pissed me off more than anything else especially that sometimes you have to have a flash of genius to understand what to do since nothing is explained to us! After that I must say that I may be an IQ lower than the recommended configuration for this game ... The point is that I was really bored and I have no desire to relaunch this game even if everything is not up to throw away. Visually it's successful, we end up with a Firewatch-like environment (with even less textures though). So here it is rather pretty and atypical but I would never understand why this kind of game requires so much performance!

"Until I Have You has a lot of cool things going for it.  Sadly, it fails in the most critical aspect - the gameplay. For all the obvious hard work that went into the artwork, cutscenes, and (mostly) inspired level designs, there’s annoying gameplay mechanics that counteract them.   The biggest offender is the controls - I never got comfortable with them.  Not to mention you can’t rebind the shoulder or trigger buttons in the options.  The pause menu was on the left shoulder button.  I can’t think of a more awkward place to place something like that in a game like this.  I also felt the sound design and music were severely lacking, especially considering the attention to detail that went into the visuals. The developer tried to add some variety to the levels, but mostly it’s just frustrating platform jumping.  Very unpolished platform jumping at that.  It really is a shame, because as I was playing Until I Have You I kept thinking that there was potential for something really cool here.  Unfortunately, by the fifth level it mostly became a “let’s just get this over with” type of affair .  And while I did finish the game, I was more than a little annoyed (and bored) by that point. While this one gets the thumbs down, I’ll still be watching this developer’s future projects.  There’s definitely signs of greatness bubbling under the surface.  Hopefully his next title will strengthen the potentials shown here and learn from the mistakes that UIHY makes. ",False,False

"I loved this game. From the action-oriented gameplay to the colorful backdrop of Raccoon City, this game is a peppy change of pace from RE2 Remake that still retains much of what made that previous remake special. The horror is downplayed this time, but in its place are fast paced action sequences that are both entertaining and, at times, harrowing. I almost whizzed every time Nemesis came hurdling onto my screen, no lie. However, by the end of the game, I was feeling like a literal god as I took out room-sized enemies with my mounds of rocket launcher ammunition. So, all of that makes it super hard for me to not recommend this game. Unless, like myself, you must own everything Resident Evil ASAP, this game is just not a good purchase if bought at full price. It’s important to know that I don’t play games quickly. I die a lot, I explore, I read slowly, etc. With that said, I installed this game this morning and I finished the campaign by this afternoon. The one and only campaign. With its recycled environments, characters, and gameplay, I feel this game should have been an expansion for Resident Evil 2 Remake. If this had started at a lower price point or had been DLC that cost $20 or $30 less, I would have recommended it wholeheartedly. However, this just doesn’t feel like a full game. I loved it, but I wouldn’t recommend it – unless it’s on sale. (See the full review  ) ",False,False

"From now on, the time has come to change the review from positive to negative. This game is too linear, too boring and too greedy. Let's start in the order of ""Linearity"" you are led along the path by the handle, everything would be fine, but .. the number of locations is too small, sometimes you need to save some money for months to pass the trail of a point. What can you ask? This is where the ""greed"" of the game comes into play. ""Greed"" - the game will never give you a high ur resource so that you increase your army. What would you understand with a premium ""rune skin"" in 3 months fell only 2 times, and it is needed for each item from 10-12 pieces and this just the beginning, for the trail of the clothes of that skin, 200 pieces will be nada, and this is already decades of unsuccessful farming. Also, the game is greedy for new units that you will never have without a huge donation, the chance of dropping is 5%, for gold you can open only 1 time in several months and it costs a lot of money at a high level. ""Boredom"" - there is no general chat, you only communicate in the clan. Even there is no private chat to ask something from knowledgeable people. There are no events from the word at all, for the holidays you will be given a premium for 1 day so that you again farm monotonous locks over and over again and you will get tired of farming the same for months at that time. The game is doomed to failure because of these 3 points, people leave it every day, at the moment there are still several clans, but their turn will come. As a clever man said in VK, ""Is this definitely a world server? And then, judging by the call of the playing people, it does not even seem to the server at a stretch"" Donate a lot or delete the game is the motto of the game. But the question is, what to donate for? For boredom, for greed, for linearity, for hastily cobbled together 2 parts of the game just to cut the dough from the fans of the trilogy? This project does not develop at all hiding behind a small team of developers (Excuse not to do anything), max that they will add new units for donation. For 5 months since the release of the game in Steam, the developers have done - nothing, 0, zero. ",False,True

"I don't normally play point & click's but decided to try this one due to a bit more spare time on my hands recently, the fact that it was included in a bundle and it looked like it had a unique graphical style. At points during the five hours or so I spent with the game it had moments that could've converted me to the genre.  The game had some scenes that followed logic and there were a couple of puzzles that gave a degree of satisfaction to solve.  Sadly, the majority of puzzles were convoluted and followed little logic.  The last chapters were the ones that carried the most guilt.  I found myself just wandering around, finding a new item and then having to revisit every object and NPC to see if the new item would interact with it to further my progress.  In the end I had to regrettably resort to a walkthrough, checking the other reviews I seem to be not alone with this. The overall experience felt cumbersome and the story had no real depth.  If the game was any longer than it was I wouldn't have persevered to the end (even though I used a guide). The game is not a complete travesty and may appeal to fans of the genre?  It's not put me off enough to not try another point & click, but I won't be recommending Truberbrook in a hurry. ",False,False

"Action, adventure, treasure, BUGS and Glitches await you in Adam Venture Chronicles,, which is pretty much the three removed Adam Venture games put into a single package.. while the game doesn't appear to have anything special..aside from new bugs and somehow more glitches.. it does offer the chance for another easy 100% game some cards and well,, that's pretty much it.. Adam Venture was an attempt to cash in on the success of the Playstations Uncharted games,, but it was kind of like buying one of those knock off Disney movies that try to cash in on those movies success, with second rate animations, bad voice acting and altered stories which are different enough to get have Disney not Sue them but not enough to actually be different..  Story -  Adam Venture is your average explorer, adventurer, dbag who scours the world looking for treasures and girls.. he's like Indiana Jones if Indiana Jones was played by Dolph Lundren...  Adam is searching for...  something something something.  It's like the original Tomb Raider if the original Tomb Raider suffered from poor jumping and glitches.. Gameplay  - think of the older Tomb Raiders, but remove the fluid motions and lack of solid foundation... Want to Climb that laddar.. enjoy flying 30 feet into the air and back across the screen..   Want to make a simple jump across a ledge.. enjoy jumping too high, hitting the wall and getting stuck there..   The game requires precise movements, and actions, but the bugs and gltiches means it's like throwing a coin into the air.. will you climb the ladder to cross the open door before it closes or get stuck crouching for 20 seconds until the door closes..   only the games buggy coding will decide.. Pros - Easy Achievements,  very casual gameplay,  so bad it's good... Con's Glitches,  bugs,  terrible voice acting,  horrible graphics even for 2015, looks like a PS1 game when the system first launched.. Recommendation I simple can't recommend this game,, it really shouldn't exist, if they had simple put the three single games into one and left out the additional bugs, glitches and bad programming I'd say go for it.. with this far inferior product it makes you wonder why they removed the original games which seemed to work nearly flawlessly..  If you can find the game in a bundle or for a sub 3 dollar price tag, i'd say maybe buy it,, I mean it'll give you a few hours of gameplay before you finish the game and add a +1 to your completed games..   Ultimately though for full price you'd be better off buying anything else.. ",False,False

"Paladins, a freebie version of Overwatch but with much more characters. Annoying thing? You gotta buy the champion pack with $$ or play tons of matches just to buy that one champion. While a freebie, it's still surprisingly fun with the biggest issue being it's matchmaking. PROS - Wide variety of heroes to keep the player interested, assuming you don't mind it's balancing problems. - Certain skins can be obtained for free - The game runs smoothly, however an unexpected crash may happen from time to time. - Auto-purchase towards passives you can obtain in each game, based on how well you do. So if ur on the losing side, expect to stay on the losing side as making a come back is more difficult. CONS - Matchmaking is the worst I've seen from any competitive game - Only a small number of maps between the 3 game modes. - The game is imbalanced in terms of certain heroes. One such example is there is a champion who almost has an execute for any champions below 30% hp. Yes that includes tanks as well. - For a competitive game, I've yet to come across a player who wants to talk in game... - If a player leaves, they are replaced by a bot who aims and plays like an Easy AI. Note you don't get warned when a player leaves. - Disconnections can randomly happen and you are stuck in an infinite loading screen unless you crash the game with task manager.  Matchmaking I've put as a Con, I'll give you a quick rundown on how bad it can get, rather suddenly as well. First couple of weeks of playing the game I decided to main Ying while trying out a few I can buy with gold. Few days a go I was on a surprisingly high 86% win rate. After that I've been on a losing streak for the past 50 games now. which has me down to 31% win rate now, in only a week. If non-ranked games are like this, I'll assume it's much worse for ranked. If this isn't a game you want to play competitively then this section of the review shouldn't bother you.

"I bought the DLC at a discount around 2,000 won, but I would have refunded even if I bought it for 200 won. It's not funny that the nude made to be cooly is not funny, it is not fun to shoot the TPS made by shooting, and the game made by breaking the mission is not fun even in the mission. There is a problem from the main screen, but the sound is not reduced. The music seems to be diminishing, but it turns on to the maximum when moving on to the next mission. It doesn't even decrease in the last mission. The option to turn off music doesn't work from scratch. There seems to be something like a conversation in the store video, but not in the game. I even bought DLC and played with a smile, but I wasn't really crazy. The female breast looks like a tumor, and ㄲㅈ looks strange like a boil on the tumor. The screen shakes up, down, left and right when the rifle is fired continuously, but it's really like a guy who has never played an FPS game. It doesn't bounce left and right while bouncing up, but just randomly up, down, left and right, shaking like an earthquake, and the screen goes up together. I'm seriously sick. The enemy AI is two-headed, but the enemy's damage is ugly, so if you want to get a little hit, you're behind. In addition, recovery is very slow, so you have to play to recover for a long time even if you hold on to the enemy. That's all right, but if the screen pops up, and even uses a rifle, I feel like I'm trying to make a sudden attack with a laptop touchpad on a serious washing machine. The missions are all together, but the tutorial ends with just shooting the target, the first mission is done by snipering in place, the second mission, the airplane mission, does not require lock-on, so shooting a missile is over, and the third mission has no save points, so no matter how far you go From the beginning. In addition, throughout the third mission, the planes come and go, shooting guns, but there is no damage, only the sound is loud, and the sound does not match. When I shoot my gun on the brick road, I hear the sound of the iron plate hitting. And in the third mission, the cover from the first mission disappears. I don't even lean against the wall.

"This series of games has been badly fucked up lately. I was a fan of this series, right up to Call of Duty: World at War. After that, further games began to turn into a complete slag. But with the announcement of COD: WWII, I got some hope that the developers have changed their minds, and our expectations will not be in vain. Yes, in a sense, the developers changed their minds, returned to the old setting, without any space, exoskeletons and robots, but alas, this did not save the game from the players' disappointment. Perhaps I'll start with the storyline. My review will probably be mainly based on it. The plot in the game was made boring and short. There are 11 short chapters waiting for us in the game, the first chapters were very boring, basically what the plot of this game was striving for will be in the last two chapters, since in the previous the plot is based on tasks, and even then it is not really there. As soon as I started to go through a single company, at 3-4 chapter I already wanted to get out of the loner and go to the ""Zombie"" mode, but continued, I really wanted to check out the mission with the plane. The game takes place during the Second World War. The game begins with a landing on the shores of Normandy (the only thing that made me happy in this game), and, of course, we play for the brave Americans. We will be told about the exploits of one soldier, and we will also be able to play for other characters. Briefly. In total, I spent about 5 hours on the passage of a single company. Multiplayer. I haven't really played it, and I'm extremely happy about that. At first, the multiplayer accepted me with connection errors, after which I connected, and forgot about them. Appeared on the map, looked around, and went to rush. So I run out from around the corner, shoot the entire clip at the enemy, and I can see that I hit him. He turns around and kills me. What did the replay show me? The replay showed me how I just walked around the corner without shooting. And all this is not due to ping, but due to server instability. After that, I was greeted by a connection error. Then I realized that a bit of dissatisfaction with the plot should be transferred to multiplayer. We worked on the graphics, but not for the better, as for me it was better in the previous parts. Familiar locations with great reflections and lighting. There is nothing to praise the locations themselves. I have nothing wrong with the cutscenes, they are performed just as well here, although they are heavily blurred. The soundtrack of the game does not shine very much. During the storyline, 2-3 compositions were played, but the compositions themselves are not bad. But I would like to praise the Russian voice acting, here it is done quite well. I couldn't check out the English voice acting, maybe I'll go through the plot again, since there are still some achievements to open, maybe I will be able to check out the English voice acting. I also want to highlight the sounds of shots, I didn’t like them, as if the developers didn’t bother, took the sounds from the oldest parts and pushed them into the game. The gameplay has not changed much, the same familiar COD. Added the exploits of a soldier and the search for souvenirs. The shooting has not changed, in principle the same and remained as in the previous units. And yes, now the first aid kits have returned to us, the only innovation in this game. Now your hp will not regenerate itself, you will have to ask for a first-aid kit from a soldier from your squad, or pick them up at locations. The game will try to please us with stealth missions, we will be able to ride and shoot on a tank with disgusting controls. This is the most miserable tank handling I've seen. We will ride a car a couple of times, and we will even be able to fly once in an airplane, which you do not get used to controlling immediately. In addition to the main character, there will be more characters for whom we can play, albeit for a short time. Call of Duty®: WWII - Disappointments Continue, But Hope Continues. Maybe someday we will be able to wait for that very game, all the same solid and old Call of Duty. But I will not recommend purchasing this part. Conscience does not allow. Take a better battle 1 for such a price, where the loner is more interesting, and the multiplayer is more stable. And for fans of a single-player game in Call of Duty, I advise you to take it only at a big discount, because even playing with multiplayer does not justify the means. ",False,False

"I haven't played such a bad game in a long time. You can tell that it comes from a single developer who has just made his first amateur attempt at developing his own game.

It doesn’t speak for a horror game if you find the places where it tries to scare you or scare you to be just funny and laughable. In general, it is not a good sign for a game if you wish after a short time that it would finally end, sigh after each subsequent scene and you just struggle to get to the end.

"I don't usually write reviews unless I see a potential but unfortunately I can't recommend this game at this stage. Game needs a whole a lot of balancing between production and consumption with the environmental events (such as invasions and the winter come). Your production is like never enough for what you consume regularly and you cant research or provide the essentials needs before the winter. About the invasions; it's happening so often you keep losing health and before recovering your folks, some other s...storm popping up. Needs more mechanics like being able to control your population's actions, free roaming -not stationary- security job assignments from the beginning and maybe grouping the security teams with some hotkeys, being able to occupy or deconstruct the existing buildings in the map -cuz hey! why I wanna build a house when there are a lot of em around- Needs a better AI -as many other already mentioned your workers just walking around the danger and waiting to be killed- Bigger maps with extended borders so we can actually pan around and see the inside of the buildings scattered around the edges. And I dont understand why the stability is keep going down all the time even tho when I find a sweet balance for a brief time. This is all I got for now. I'll keep updating my review on this one as it keeps progressing. Don't get me wrong tho. Im not saying this game is just bad. all im saying is, it needs a better polished gameplay to actually have fun and focus on management with the full control of the map and its features. ",False,True

"Huge disapointment. I'm a huge Panzer Corps fan and I could'nt wait for this game to come out. I have played this game and have run into some errors that need to be adressed  Let me start with what this game gets right.  1. AT guns act like artilery when defending against hard targets, ei tanks, which is a good feature that makes both Tank destroyers and AT guns usefull and instrumental both attacking and defending.  2. The option for troops to use a transport and then dismount is also a very welcome feature.  3. The ability to split units in 2 is also very great feature that makes encirclement and making enemy units surrender easier and satisfiying.  4. The encirclement system is good, you can create big pokes and just capture many troops, speaking of which,  5. Being able to capture enemy equipment and use it in your army is an awesome feature, thought I would  6. I also like that recon units improve the artilerry, bombing runs, air strikes, and attacks. It makes them very usefull on the battle field.  Now with all the positives out of the way, lets get to the negatives and why they break the game 1. Artillery sucks: artillery, has been nerfed compared to the original. I do like that if artilery fires on another artilerry unit, said unit will fire back, a good feature since artilerry duels were a thing, especially in WW1. But how is artilerry nerfed? Well It doesnt do a good job and protecting your infantry or your tanks, I can get the reason for this was the following philosophy: artillery for soft targets, wile AT guns for hard, however this is a silly interpreteation as in WW2 artilerry fired at advancing tank formations defensively, and some times even efectively. They are firing rounds that if they fired directly at tanks would destroy them at one hit, even landing close would incapasitate tanks. So the reasoning for nerfing arty against armour is silly in my opinion. But there are so many times I have artilerry defending my troops, and mind you this is enemy infantry unit with no support, they atack my infantry with atrilery support and they end up either, inflicting more casualties, despite the atrilerry support, they rout my infantry despite being supported. So in the area were artilerry is supposed to excell in, soft targets, it completly flops. Which leads to my next point 2. Infantry combat is broken: Infantry combat feels broken, its not like the original. Here in Panzer corps 2 infantry have at minimum 15 points instad of 10, I guess the idea was to represent the size of infantry divisions in the war but what ends up happening is this : Infantry feel like meat bags you have to punch with your own infantry. YOUR infantry take horendous casualties, even in full strength defending in close terrain. Its frustraiting to see the enemy charge its infantry with out carring about the concecuenses against your own, and despite yours having artillery or good terain to defend take horrible casualties. Mean wile I have to blast the hell out of enemy positions with my artilerry if not, my assults produre horrific assaults.  Because he who had the most guns had the most fire power and had a big advangage on the battle field. In Panzer corp 1 if you attacked a full strengthed infantry unit with another unit with equal stregth, and there was artilerry defending it the assault would end terribly for the attacker. Artilery was a good shield, protecting tanks and infantry as the turn passed from both infantry and tanks, infantry stupid enought to attack, or because they could not see it because of line of sight would get destroyed, and that was in the open, in close terrain it was even worse. Tanks, wile rearly sufering damage, were supressed, thus making their attacks useless. Now artilerry feels weak and useless. In the original if I had 2 pieces the assault would be stopped altogether because the supretion and casualties were so bad on the infantry, that is a huge diference in the way the game plays. The attack defend system of infantry aslo feels broken. In my opinion it should be even, both in attack and defendese, the only things affecting the out come being, terrain, which should have a 25% affect on the out come of any engagement, as the saying goes ""geography is destiny' not just for countries, but for hole battles through out history. The initiative, the experiance, and finaly support, recon, atrillery, air support, naval tanks etc should then be the deciders in the out come of an engagement.  Im playing in marshal dificulty. I decide to go to africa  1. thing I dont like, no italian units into the corp. Why?  The reason I loved africa corps was because of that, having my German and Italian units fight together as brothers, covering eachothers backs and each bringing something to the table.  But Im getting of topic I get over that. Im in africa kicking ass. Then at Gazala I complete all my objectives, including the bonus ones. I then get a decision, either to go after the allies into egypt or go to el alamein, esentialy just giving up the initiative and letting the british take the tide of the war.  What I love about this the message ""this decision will have irreversible consecuances on the war"" But then when I click to go to egypt, it tells me I need 5000 perstige in order to ""persuade"" high comand to go to egypt. What the ♥♥♥♥!? Im sorry for my languege but this complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Whats the point of this? There is not a single scenario in any Panzer corp campaing or dlc were it requiers you to have x amount of prestige to go to the next mission, that is pure bull, and it pisses me of and makes no scense. If your playing this game, your in it to win, so why would a rational person choose a campain path of inevitable defeat? This absolutely infutriating, in the following scenerio I was reminded about how I lost the initiative of the war, not because I dint fullfil all my objectives in time, not because I dint fight hard enought, no, because I dint have enought stupid prestige to ""presuade"" some ignorant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at high comand to uh, o yea, win the damn war! I just dint even bother and I just let my army be destoyed because whats the point of fighting on if I lost already?  On top of that, once I lost the scenario, the campaing ended, wtf? In the original Panzer corp, if you got marginal victories, and even full deafeats in others you would go down the historical path, however there were still chances, twists and turns, but the campaing continued till the defense of the Reich, which I like looking back. Now you mite be thinking, based on what I said above, why would I then praise this? Well because at least in Panzer corps 1 you would fight to the last man or with a truce with the Soviets or the western Allies, which I like the idea. Also there was not a prestige cost... I was suprised there was not a ""defeated"" campaing were you fight say the invation of sicily or the ardenss like the original. Once its over its over. Wile you can say there were missions in panzer corps 1 were you lost it was over period and its true, however there were battles that even if you lost, you could still continue the fight and bounce back, here you dont get that.  So yea thats my rant, review of Panzer Corps 2,  I dont say this to attack the devs or slitherine, I think the devs care about this game and that they are trying to improve the game. Please any dev that reads this, consider doing the following, just a sugestion as a fan. 1. Buff artilerry so it feels more like it did in the original 2. Re work infantry: a make them have 10 points of strenght like the rest of the units in the game, or at the very least make terrain more influencial in an outcome of a battle. Re work the combat between infantry vs infantry as I have described above.   3. No prestige barriers for missions. Just no, get rid of them for they should not exist.  Thats literally it, if you do those things I garante people will love the game more and the combat will be near perfect.",False,False

"I've spent hours on this game and I love the art/voice acting/anime style and the card mechanics and that it has a story.

Some of the newest packs has a really low chance for legendary cards. (So for me it feels like a P2W)  You can unlock all the cards for your deck that you wanted to build without paying, but by then a new expansion will have been released which makes your deck outdated.

I will discard the rest of ethical issues and plot twists, because everything here was pretty short in content, but still interesting. Although, again, this is nothing more than an addon. Addon. Addonyushechka. Little time. I spent a total of 7 hours in the game. And here the emphasis was taken on the mechanics of sea battles, battles for forts, etc., etc. Boring and sad, repetition of what he saw in the flag. The game did not really bring anything new in terms of gameplay and mechanics in general. And these movements on the ship infuriated more than they looked colorful and interesting. Yes, the atmosphere is not bad, but I will repeat it over and over again - it gets boring too quickly. The game would be nice if it were presented as a standalone project and increased in screen time with new mechanics and just something else new in addition to everything else above. Or it would look good as a prologue to the unit (because the unit itself is not very long, for that matter). With Haytham it turned out very well. Although the third part is still stuffy. And the dissonance was much stronger due to the unattractiveness of Chingachgook as a character and vice versa sympathy for Haytham, even if he was a Templar (we played for him !!! 111)) 00). Well, as a conclusion from all the nonsense that I write, I still do not recommend the horn, even if in the series it really stands out because of the filing, but not so much as to be a funky game.

"An average nasty beat'em up platformer about Batman, which is a kind of plot branch from the original Arkham Origins, where the game takes place in Blackgate prison, which was divided into 3 parts between the Joker, Penguin and Black Mask. And our hero must valiantly rescue the hostages by eliminating all 3 targets. The plot in this game is simple and clear from the first take. The whole world of the game is divided into 4 locations. Moreover, it will be possible to move freely between these locations, rather it will even be necessary to move, since Batman arrives at Blackgate with empty pockets, and all gadgets must be collected as you progress. Moreover, you often have to dodge between rooms, not knowing where to go (after all, there are a lot of things hidden on the map), besides, the geometry of the game in the 2.5D genre only confuses, and the level design is rather meager. The spoiled combat is also depressing, here it is even worse than in Batman: Arkham Origins. I don’t envy those who decide to play this port from the consoles on the keyboard, because on the controller Batman can sometimes disobey and miss blows or not deliver them himself. Of the three bosses, the Joker was the most interesting, the elimination of the rest took place according to the ""distract-hit"" tactics. If you are expecting interesting puzzles from this platformer, then in vain. Here, an alternative to this is the endless scanner in Detective mode, with which you need to search for evidence for investigation. The lesson is far from the most pleasant. And sometimes you have to scan simple things to madness. For example, to throw a Batarang at a lamp, you first need to scan the lamp and find out, bitch, that it can be knocked down by Batarang. And this must be done with each lamp, because the memory of Batman's gadgets is like a fish, it is erased after a few seconds. Although I am a DC fan who has read hundreds of comics about Batman and knows this universe quite well, I tried to write the most objective opinion about the game (although another would praise it). Therefore, I recommend it only to fans, and to the same fans who are madly in love with this series like me. The rest can walk by. ",False,False

"In conclusion, don't buy. It's a ridiculous kusoge that uses malicious PV fraud and early access as an excuse. [Bad deeds of development before release] ・ The first release was announced on December 19th, but it was postponed (it seems that it was announced in advance at this time) ・ The second countdown site was set up to raise expectations, but the countdown was over Only the trailer video came out. No notice to the user (the number of people waiting at Twitch at this time is about 100,000) ・ Apologize only a few hours after the third postponement. When it was released, it was announced again, but it was not issued after all. Although the advance access key was given to the popular distributor, there was no server there, and there were stunned distributors and tens of thousands of viewers. In addition, before the apology, a person who developed at Discord once opened his mouth, but the word was ""Stop spam"".・ A few hours later, the server finally opened and the distributor played in advance, and then a few hours later it was opened to general players. Even though I do not know when it will be released, the release date of the lie so as not to lose topicality Frequently posted to deceive users (If development is difficult, just put it on Steam as a release soon. The purpose is too explicit to collect money) The resulting game is under-optimized In a jerky game, the development of ARK has just returned to the beginning. It seems that the only answer I got after developing ARK for several years was that ""it doesn't matter what game you put out if you use early access as a shield"". [Bad points of the game] (Impression of playing PvE Saba with 6 relatives) ・ If you enter the server to start the game, Timeout will occur at the end of loading for 3 minutes or more (Never enter the server on the first load) ) Ah.・ If you enter again and respawn at an appropriate place, you will be surrounded by enemies of unreasonable strength and die instantly. Apparently, this happens when the spring location is bad (no information at all). Hah. After changing the spring to a relatively peaceful place and starting a decent play, you realize that 99% of the elements you see in the PV of this game can only be touched after the endlessly long primitive era. .. A large-scale naval battle is taking place in PV, but the reality is that it is a primitive era simulator that just hits trees and stones like a fool. Hah.・ Although the level system is adopted, the initial level cap is 8. From that point onward, you will not be released unless you board a ship and go out to the open ocean. You can increase the items that can be crafted while taking skills, but if you do not release the skill to build a ship, it will get stuck. (Although I can reassign my skills) I really don't understand why I made this specification. Hah.・ Currently, there are only NA and EU servers, and the mackerel is too poor to die. Even if you play normally, it will be a rubber band, and after a while it will time out and be kicked out.・ In the first place, the required materials for making a ship are abnormally high. As you can see if it is a huge ship in the final stage, it takes a lot of time and effort to go out to the open sea in the early stage. It takes more than 4 hours to make a raft. Ah.・ Although the required materials are high, the enemy is also unusually strong. Lv200 monsters with instant death class attack power are walking around that area, and since they are active, they will attack from the other side without doing anything, and they will relentlessly try to destroy the building, so they will lure you on the spot. I can't get away from it, and at worst I can't get close to the building I made for the rest of my life. Hah.・ The eating and drinking system is also unusually troublesome. There is no drinkable water on the island of the early spawns, so you have to dig the ground to find water, but that water is not always available everywhere and you have to dig a damp ground, which is deadly troublesome. As for food, there is an unknown system called vitamins, and if you eat only the blueberries that can be harvested in that area, you will be deficient in other vitamins, and eventually your legs will break and you will die. Huh? -You can protect the item warehouse with a password, but you cannot password protect craft buildings such as workbenches and campfires. In other words, theft is easy even if it is PvE.・ A large ship built over 9 hours can only accommodate 3 people and is slow enough to die. If the number of passengers is exceeded, the ship will not move at all. Moreover, all the labor is wasted because if the ship is completed away from the port, nothing will happen. Surprisingly, a three-seater has the same number of passengers as a raft. Huh?・ There are a lot of other things I can't write. Even if you learn the skill, you will not remember all the bugs, when you die, the character screen will suddenly appear, and if you make the character as you are told, the original character will disappear, crash ... What city did you see on PV? What about a huge ship? What about a ghost ship? What's the big monster? What about a gun? What about naval battles? What about NPCs? What about the siege? It's really clear that the early test play wasn't right, as there was no early play video on the PV. I guess I used it in cheats and skipped the beginning properly. I don't know if you're trying to leave all debugging to the user just because it's early access, but it's usually better to disappoint customers. ",False,True
"Honestly, I broke down and deleted the game. A regular game for 96. Remembering what games were then, I can say with complete confidence that they made the game a tidbit for their year. BUT!

First, they showed a nuclear explosion, with a flying out shield, and in the place where the explosion was a diamond with a girl. Then they show a scene in a hotel where Lara is hired as a treasure hunter. Music. In the main menu, this is an enumeration of some buzzers. In the game, you hardly pay attention to the music, it is there, but it merges with the dynamics of the game and is taken for granted.

"Anyone who knows and has loved Neverhood knows roughly what to expect at Armikrog. The game itself has been implemented nicely. Respect for the work that went into development and implementation. It is a lot of work to put everything into modeling clay and to record everything via stop motion. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the game at all at the moment. The release of Armikrog was postponed several times due to bugs, but there were or are still such blatant bugs after the release that two savegames cannot be played again with me because Tommy cannot be moved. Subtitles are sometimes not displayed at all, music simply stops playing. If you take a look at the Armikrog forums on Steam, you'll find a lot more bugs. Despite two defective savegames, I played the game through in just under six hours. The puzzles are a bit tricky, but too easy to solve. A little logical understanding is absolutely sufficient for this. You have a common thread in the game that you can't leave. I think I remember that in between at Neverhood one was often led on the wrong track. For example, jumping out of the large basin in which the water was drained ... If you jumped through the drain back then you would fly off the planet and the game was over, so to speak. Or when you had eaten the apple of the tree and this was repeated many times. Unfortunately, such small gimmicks / features are completely missing in Armikrog. In addition, the Steam Cloud cannot be used. Savegames are located locally on one computer and cannot be copied to another computer. I am happy to be taught better, but there was no way to do it and it was not discussed in the forum. Conclusion: I went into the game with high expectations and was bitterly disappointed. Even if I like the game, due to the bugs and the very short story it is absolutely not worth 25 euros, a maximum of 9.90 euros. I hope that there will be a little more with updates and possible DLC's. But it would be awesome if you had to pay money for the DLC's ... ",False,False

"I bought a code for this game from a site called ♥♥♥, a site I use frequently for other games I want at a discounted price. I got a notification this morning that the game has been removed from my account, after I have owned and played it for almost a month. I had heard about the controversy with 505 Games and this game in particular, how they would purposefully downgrade people who bought the ultimate edition of Control, on consoles, screwing them out of their money, but keeping the revenue for themselves, of course. I can't help but feel these issues are related because of how reliable ♥♥♥ is, and how this is the only time I've ever had this issue, and naturally it's with a game that has had issues of this caliber in the past, and on a larger scale. But how is the game? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ phenomenal. It had an unnerving and almost surreal feeling to it, especially since you have no idea what's going on. I found myself actively reading collectibles trying to figure out just what the hell is going on; something I admittedly never do in any other games. The story is great, the characters' and their actors' performances were great, and the game just looks amazing and runs so well. However, I'm going to give this a negative review purely to get everyone's attention for what I have to say: As great as this game is, 505 Games is so damn shady with their products, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the people who support them. The only reason I can think of to why you shouldn't buy this game is to spite the people who will take it back from me, keep your money, and put the blame on you. This isn't necessarily an endorsement for ♥♥♥, but I have NEVER had this issue before with any other game code I purchased. I suggest that everyone who sees this steers clear of it until 505 Games grows the ♥♥♥♥ up. Edit: I have no idea why it censored the name of the website I bought the keys from but let's try something. The website is called G (the 7th letter in the alphabet) 2 (the second number) A (the first letter int he alphabet). That may have been a little overboard, but I don't get why it would censor a whole website. ",False,False

"As it stands I do not recommend it despite the few positive points that keep me on this game. I admit that I expected to have more simulation, but this is clearly a game for casu.

The ""dead eye"" view where you see all the herbs, mushrooms etc in fluorescent yellow ... which totally ruins the immersion I wonder what the bow or even the crossbow is for because with the spear you have one shot the mobs ... The spear? complicated ? In reality yes when the target is moving, but you just have to wait for the animal to move away for 3 seconds, to see it graze a few meters further with a spear in its anus. (throws from J. Rambo a little because you need a ROUND to craft one, no small piece of wood found on the ground no.) I can continue but I will stop there for the negative points. For the positive points there is: it still makes you want to invest, it's fluid, rather pretty, interface blah yeah gone, we can see his feet that's cool, and ....

"The more I think about this game, the more I feel insulted. This review will contain some minor spoilers, if you can consider this a story that can be spoiled... DrawDistance has created here a very half-arsed attempt at story telling and game design. I'm not sure if they thought they were being clever or subversive but what we got here is a 'game' which seems like it was shipped unfinished - they either ran out of time, budget, enthusiasm, ideas or all of the above. Okay, time for a little positivity don't you think? The art in this game is pretty good, I can dig it. The soundscapes and music are fitting and well produced, not that I can remember anything that stood out. While it was delayed on release - Coteries of New York is available for Linux (and Mac), which I'm grateful for, and was one of two reasons I bought this game. It runs really well without any problems and seems a solid linux build. (But then again there isn't a lot going on here it's all text and slightly moving backgrounds.) Now.. I think that's it for the positive... Lets get ragging on it again! Coteries of New York is a roughly 6 hour text adventure with a choose-your-own illusion. Remember when I said before there were two reasons I bought this? (You should it was only in the last paragraph) The second reason was that this is a story set in the cult classic world of Vampire: The Masquerade. Fans of other products of the universe will know that the bar is set pretty high here - I was hoping for something a little special. Well... in   game you can choose three clans, coincidentally all three are the most normal, close to human and easily interchangeable vampire types in the series. Anything more intriguing would require large re-writes and diversions of the 'story'. The reason is clear, there are no branching paths, no alternate endings to this, merely slightly different flavours with the same end result. The writing prior to the end of the game is totally passable. It's not going to win any awards, just a bit ham-handed, but it's fine. One of the things that I found very jarring though was the extremely contemporary nature of some of the writing, with direct references to YouTube, Fugazi and other on-the-nose comparisons to real world stuff.  It get's really bad when the end of the game comes (as abruptly as it does) it reveals its colours as a cliched and lazily written gotcha, I wasn't upset that this game was entirely reading, I wasn't upset that the choices were very limited, I wasn't upset that I couldn't play Malkavian and my options were all boring and 'not me', I wasn't upset that this game pulls the forced diversity and female representation card forcibly hard and even references racism in the most awkward way during dialogue. I   upset when after so many in-game days playing the game, all of my in-progress friend stories were cut short because SURPRISE ♥♥♥♥♥♥! ENDING! See, in this game you're instructed to go and make some friends and are given 6 or so contacts. What the game never explains is that you've got limited time to pick just two so the game can try and make the end more impactful and... unique. SUBVERSION ♥♥♥♥♥♥. SURPRISED YET? WOAH DUDE. At the end of this game not only is everything left as an untidy loose end, you can't even choose your fate. The end doesn't even fit well into the vampire universe, not really. What's more is that the best written, most interesting character in the game, the sheriff, who has hints about his past dripped in all over, just stops being part of the story about half way in. If you can't tell I'm pretty salty about my purchase and this was pretty incoherent. Just like Coteries of New York I'll end this review un ",False,False

"Endlich kam ich selbst dazu den neuesten Ableger vom Hause Square Enix anzuspielen. Eines vorweg, ich bin ein Final Fantasy Veteran, habe also alle spiele schon gespielt. Nun möcht ich meine Meinung zu diesem Teil schreiben. Als ich mich die Windwos Edition geholt habe war die Aufregung groß, ich wollte mich mit Absicht nicht vorher groß Spoilern was mich in diesem Spiel erwartet - nur die Story habe ich mir hier und da ein paar Fetzen aus dem Internet geholt. Zum Kampfsystem selbst sah ich auch nur 1-2 Videos, war hier nicht großer Freude, jedoch ließ ich mich auf etwas ""Neues"" ein. Nun denn zu den positiven Aspekten: +wie üblich von Final Fantasy Teilen, das Spiel lasst sich von der Grafik her blicken. Die Welt - soviel ich gesehen habe ist sehr schön, all das ließ Freude die Welt und jede ihrer Ecken und Weiten zu erkunden +Soundtrack, auch wie hier üblich, der Soundtrack ist hervorragend. Baut eine angenehme Atmosphäre auf und passt sich an gewisse Situation sehr gut an, wenns mal brennslig wird Zu den ""ganz ok"" Aspekten: ~die Charaktere und die NPCs sehen alle sehr gut und detailiert aus. Die Stimmen - japanisch sub - sind gut vertont und eine Abwechslung beim Aussehen der NPCs ist immens.  ~UI ist ganz ok, übersichtlich so guts geht, man braucht etwas Zeit reinzukommen aber man gewöhnt sich dran Nun zu den negativen Aspekten: - Ständige ""Anquatschen"" und nervende Cutscenes wenn ich Nachts fahren will. Einmal ist ok, aber jedes mal? Wenn ich nachts fahren will dann will ich nachts fahren. Danke Mammi dass du mich jedes mal fragst und mich darauf hinweist, dass es gefährlich ist. Ob dies später ganz weg kommt weiß ich nicht...aber innerhalb der 16 Stunden hatte ich es oft genug. Einmal reicht...danke, ich habs kapiert. - Magie....Magie??? Das ständige Nachcraften der ""Magie"" nervt...echt...noch dazu scheints mir, als wäre Magie kein fester Bestandteil des Kampfsystem (zu diesem komme ich noch). Es ist einfach ein ""nice to have"" Skill, man benutzt es ein paar Mal und dann wieder...nachcraften und extra nochmal ausrüsten. Bevor ich anfange die Materialien für Magienutzung zu farmen, hoffe ich einfach mal auf dem Weg ein paar dieser Stellen zu treffen wo ich etwas absorbieren kann, gut wenn mans hat, aber es ging zumindest in meine 16h komplett ohne. Und dass die Magie andere Mitstreiter verletzen kann, lässt für mich daraus schließen, dass Magie auch im Endgame kein allzu regelmäßige Funktion haben wird. Schade. -Nun das Kampfsystem, mein Totschlagargument wieso ich das Spiel fürs erste in der Bibliothek ungespielt lassen werde, und irgendwann das Spiel durchbeißen werde, nur ums einmal durchgespielt zu haben. Nun, FF13-3 war schon etwas Neues, SE traut sich neue Sachen auszuprobieren, was ich auch gut finde, nur kanns aus meiner Sicht deutlich in die Hosen gehen etwas derart ""neues"" zu implementieren, noch dazu sich so weit von den Wurzeln von Final Fantasy orientiert. Kampfsystem sieht in etwa so aus: Kreis gedrückt halten, dann hier und da bisschen Dreieck um am Gegner näher zu sein, dann wieder Kreis gedrückt halten, es passiert alles automatisch. Manchmal warnt es dich zu blocken....eben aber nur manchmal, so, jetzt muss man auch noch 1. auf den Gegner vor dir achten was er macht, um ausweichen zu können. In der Art ok, blöd aber wirds wenn aus deiner Kameraperspektive ein Gegner ein Angriff macht der nicht die Blockanzeige schaltet + wenn man im hohen Gebüsch kämpft und den Gegner vor sich nicht richtig sehen kann..... Viele finden das Spiel anscheinend gut, aber ich bin leider überhaupt nicht warm geworden, und das macht mich wirklich sehr sehr traurig, das erste Final Fantasy mit dem ich komplett nichts anfangen kann....FF13 ging ja wie gesagt noch irgendwie, man sah zumindest teilweise noch die alten Aspekte des classischen Final Fantasy, auch der 3. Teil der Reihe ging noch. Jedoch, der 15er schlägt aus meiner Sicht komplett in eine andere Richtung....nicht ein Teil einer Serie für das Kampfsystem das ich so liebte. Also, was nun, ist dies jetzt ein Grundstein für weitere Final Fantasy wie sie aussehen werden? Ich bete, dass es nicht so ist, eine Serie die für mich dann sterben wird. Man muss das Rad nicht immer so neu erfinden, altes bewährt sich meiner Meinung nach am öftesten, denn, das Alte hat Final Fantasy - den Namen - zu der Stärke verholfen die es heute hat.  Man will neue Fans gewinnen? Ich habe üüüüberhaupt kein Problem damit....nur, ich als alter Fan bin dann derjenige den sie verlieren werden, leider. Und schmerzt SE vermutlich auch gar nicht, da sie immer noch genug Fans haben, für mich persönlich aber schade. Was das Spiel für mich zumindest hätte retten können, wäre ein teils Rundenbasiertes Kampfsystem, klar das herumhüpfen und herumporten ist alles nett und schön....aber für solche Spiele hol ich mir dann Deus Ex, oder Bayonetta oder Devil May Cry...aber wenn ich FF zocken will, dann nicht so was. Ich will öfter Magie verwenden, ich will mir den Gegner den ich gerade bekämpfen will in Ruhe aussuchen können - in dem Kampfsystem mag man gar nicht erst in einen versammeltem Mob reinhüpfen, da man nur Ausweichen darf ohne Ende. 1-2 Mal Magie verwenden und das wars....Es hat so viel an Persönlichkeit verloren, ich kanns nicht fassen, dass man uns nur noch ein Kreis drücken zumutet...zumindest ein 2. alternatives Kampfsystem einbauen, wäre möglich gewesen, aber leider nix.  Sorry, ein klares Nein von mir für dieses Spiel, auch wenn ich nicht viel gesehen habe, aber für den Anfang reicht es mir, ich bin nicht warm geworden und bezweifel, dass sich dies so schnell ändern wird. Dennoch ein großes Lob an die Entwickler für ihre Mühen!",False,False

"I'll start by saying that if you enjoyed the first Rage, this one will be a let down. Handing over development to Avalanche studios was a poor decision by Id Software as they clearly didn't put the same effort into this game as Id put into Rage 1. The first bad decision was the choice to make it open world. I don't have anything against open world games, but there needs to be enough variety and effort put in to make it work. There are not enough things to do, and extremely repetitive ""fetch quests"" that have you killing the same enemies over and over again in different locations that you've probably already visited a few times before. There are no proper quests or unique enough environments to make this open world worthy of living up to the first game (or any game for that matter).  Story wise it might take someone 8 hours or less to complete the main quest, which is basic and your typical revenge story. It's over long before you expect it to be, similar to how the first game was. Don't get me wrong, Rage 2 still has very enjoyable gunplay. Most weapons are fun to use but there are not nearly enough to choose from. Some guns I didn't even feel the need to use at all, and the lack of proper visual upgrades made the guns less interesting than they could have been. For example instead of a visual change/animation change to indicate you've made an upgrade, there were just lazy upgrades like increasing the fire rate, or increasing your chance to get a critical hit. Disappointing to say the least. The menu and interface is also very buggy and definitely not mouse and keyboard friendly. Sometimes I can click on things with my mouse, other times I have to press a certain key on my keyboard. Also disappointing. As someone who loved Rage 1 (an unpopular stance I know), I could go on and on about things that disappointed me with Rage 2 by comparison. But I'll leave my ranting out of this review and simply say that Rage 2 is a let down both as a sequel to the first, but also as a standalone open world FPS. ",False,False

I assume that people have complained about how easy the previous game were but seriously it was that easy to blow up stuff part that was so great and fun about those games and if the developers actually wanted to please everyone then they could make choosing between limited and unlimited vehicle ammo a feature instead of giving each vehicle pathetically low amount of ammo. What's even worse is that they have replaced the fun challenges in Just Cause 3 with, well, not so challenging but more like annoying activities like drive a certain vehicle through a ring, some times placed in very difficult to reach places AND they totally changed those awesome wingsuit challenges and made it dumb and extremely simple. Why?? The DLCs are not great either. They are all very repetitive.

"Hard Reset is the first film of the Polish studio Flying Wild Hog. From the presentations of the game, I got the impression that it is an old school 3D event, so I included the title in my list of mandatory titles. However, the game lay on my disc for a really long time and even though the game is relatively short, at least according to the available data, which I registered, my own playing lasted like a week before the payout. I finished the Hard Reset in the end, but my rating falls into the gray average, after all as a monotonous gray graphic design. The game is a sci-fi action in which you try to save the Bezoar, the last bastion of human resistance from the machines that have taken over the world. The story is presented by comic divisions between levels, which are interestingly conceived graphically. However, the game itself is graphically very stereotypical. The introductory locations are enriched with colorful neons, which evoke a bit of Blade Runner, but later they still seemed visually similar, even though the environment was partially changing. Hard Reset is a classic arena action in which enemies in the form of machines and robots of various types and sizes begin to pounce on you after reaching a key point. I see the mentioned old school only in the presence of secrets, which usually consist of blasting walls or finding a sunken corner. You can't even go back, because the way back is usually blocked. The levels are usually winding, but the path is linear, without having to think too much about the next step. In fact, there are still first aid kits, which is currently also a symptom of a retro wave. The action is quite monotonous, there are not too many types of machines, their intelligence lies in the fact that they pounce on you blindly, so the scheme of zigzagging between them and firing with your weapons is constantly repeated. You must eliminate all enemies before moving further on the map. I was not satisfied with the weapon equipment. You have a choice of two types - firearms and plasma, and you gradually upgrade them for the experience points gained at the terminals. In the end, you get a classic rocket launcher, shotgun or machine gun as in classic 3D actions. But the classic scheme of collecting weapons would be my favorite. The difficulty is set quite pleasantly, I went through the medium difficulty without major obstacles. The redux version has a fast save, unlike the original version, here the game would probably be a bigger problem for me. You have a set number of points in each mission. which you should reach in the level, however, it is not clear what you have to do. In the introduction, the points increase for the destruction of the environment, but later, where this decoration is not, I simply stopped dealing with this indicator. The bosses deserve praise, one at the end of the basic game and the other within the data disc, where you gradually turn their vulnerabilities around them, as the game suggests. They are not too difficult, but they just don't give up. I must also mention the classic ailment of games from Flying Wild Hog, namely the complexity of the graphics card, which, like the Devolver Land Expo, roared like a race. Although it is an older title. Hard Reset was simply not my cup of coffee and I could not tune in to the sci-fi wave it presents. It's not a problem, but for me it's just an average title, which I'll probably soon forget, and rather than the pros, I remember the negatives. Pros: Quick-release action. Boss. Cons: Monotone graphics, low number of enemy types. Linearity. Weapons upgrade system. 60% ",False,False

Indeed, with the parameters at the minimum, the game runs smoothly on my computer, I have a framerate of maybe 40-60 FPS, which is enough for me for a game in which only the scenario interests me. that was for the first time that I started the game. Now I restart the game a second time, and there it is the disaster, I have vertiginous drops in the framerate, I go from 60 to 5 FPS every 3 seconds or so, which makes the game perfectly unplayable. More ♥♥♥♥ I formatted my PC, so I reinstalled Wolfenstein and there MIRACLE: it works again like the first time. Then I close it and reopen it, and there ... My hopes are gone. I still displayed my performance to see where the problem is, and my graphics card is not wrong NOWHERE, it is my CPU that is bottlenecked, which in itself does not make sense , since it even fits largely in the config. I specify that installing it on the HDD or SSD does not change anything. Here I am speaking to the developers of the game, if they will take the trouble to read: stop sabotaging your PC versions, it does not lead to anything, I would remind you that this game is based on the same graphic components as DOOM 2016 seems to me, which doesn't make sense, considering that this game runs like clockwork on my PC. And the first one who tells me that I do not fit in the minimum configuration, I will remind him that the game runs perfectly well on the first launch, so your argument is obsolete.

"it's time to sacrifice a new game template for always hungry Steam Gods Turns out this wasn't much of a game. Which is unfortunate, it could be a good foundation. The art style is nice and colorful, the handling is dull but functional. It recognizes my controller, even if in both cases it only uses directional keys for movement. The finish line works. It keeps track of drift points and for whatever reason there's coins to collect. Its enough that you could attempt and make a game out of it. Obviously that's not what you get with Extreme Drifters. Thinking back, the existence of asset flips is stupefying, it puts things to perspective on what should be considered a bad game, or the creation of a brand new category ""littering"". Before steam, it would go without saying that a trash game would have rules and a clear goal/purpose.  Not this game, no.  Where is the challenge? Who are these ""mightiest rivals""? The way this game is not designed, makes winning inevitable. ",False,False

"Vacant is a short adventure game based on the same name network graphic novel by Heather Nannelli who is also the developer of this game. Heather Nannelli is   but a newbie in video game developing. 1.   The game takes place either in an alternative universe or in the far future where people live in a same city with representatives of another anthropoid species. The heroine is an intern in the government agency Eye and on her first day she gets put on a case about three missing citizens. The game background could be interesting if Heather brought in more information from her graphic novel. Unfortunately the story itself, which started so promisingly, ended in nothing. Neither the characters themselves nor their motivation are disclosed (especially as regards the strange alien). You know stock characters without real emotions. Due to its length (less than 1 hour) and ludicrous plot Heather Nannelli’s game looks like a demo version not a polished game. 2.   You need only to walk, talk and look at active objects.  You won’t exercise your mind solving puzzles or finding secrets and items because the game is a walking simulator itself. There are serious problems with navigation in the game: the heroine moves at a very slow pace and periodically gets stuck.  3.   When you are talking / viewing items you can choose a reply / action option but your choice does not affect anything. Besides there are some typos and misspelling in the text. 4.   Character’s portraits appearing during conversations are of good quality and painted in interesting style. I decided to buy the game because of this portraits and the Steam tag ""adventure game"". To my disappointment in the game itself, the 3-D models’ quality is clearly below portraits. The game cannot be played in full screen mode and the developer can’t solve the issue. 5.   Sounds in the game are standard-free and   is not audible in the game. You can hear Holly Standbrook as a narrator in the trailer.  6.   A game lasting less than one hour with stock characters and a boring story is not worth to buy it. ______________________________________________________________ Vacant – это короткая приключенческая игра на основе  одноименного сетевого графического романа за авторством Хитер Наннелли, которая же является и разработчиком данной игры.  Хитер Наннелли –  , но новичок в сфере разработки видео-игр. 1.	  Действие в игре происходит либо в альтернативной вселенной, либо в далеком будущем, где люди живут в одном городе с представителями иных человекообразных видов. Главная героиня - стажер в правительственном агентстве «Око» и в первый же день ее назначили на дело о трех пропавших гражданах.  Мир игры мог бы быть интересным, если бы Хитер привнесла в игру больше информации из своего графического романа.  К сожалению, сама история, которая так многообещающе началась, закончилась ничем. Не раскрыты ни характеры персонажей, ни их мотивация (особенно это касается странного инопланетянина). Вот такие картонные персонажи без настоящих эмоций. Почему никто не проявляет никаких эмоций на грубость, угрозу убийства или появление призраков? Из-за своей продолжительности (менее 1 часа) и нелепого сюжета игра Хитер Наннелли больше напоминает демо-версию, а не законченную игру. 2.	  В игре от вас требуется только ходить, разговаривать и читать/смотреть на активные объекты. Вам не придется напрягать мозг, решая пазлы или отыскивая секреты и предметы, потому что эта игра является симулятором ходьбы. В игре существуют серьезные проблемы с этим самым хождением: главная героиня двигается очень медленно и периодически застревает.  3.	  При разговоре/ рассматривании предметов можно выбрать вариант реплики/ действия, но ваш выбор ни на что не влияет. Кроме того, в текстах есть опечатки и ошибки. 4.	   Портреты персонажей, появляющиеся при разговорах, хорошего качества и написаны в интересном стиле. Именно из-за этих портретов и тега в Стиме «приключенческая игра» я и решил купить игру. К моему разочарованию в самой игре качество 3-Д моделей явно хуже портретов. Игра не идет в полноэкранном режиме, а разработчица игры не может решить эту проблему. 5.	  Звуки в игре стандартно-бесплатные, а   в игре не слышна. В рекламном ролике вы можете услышать Холли Стэндбрук в качестве рассказчика.  6.	  Игра продолжительностью меньше одного часа, с картонными персонажами и скучной историей, не стоит того, чтобы ее покупать. ",False,False

"When I bought this game, I hoped that it would be something like a Flashback game, but only in the entourage of an alternative history of the USSR, but how wrong I was .... I don't even know what minus the game should start with .... perhaps with controls. It's not very convenient, I don't know what the creator of the game was thinking when he made it? In the game, you can control both the mouse (this is in a platform game !!!) and the keyboard, and in some moments and both at the same time, couldn't you have done everything like in all other games, fucking reinvent the wheel! I won't say anything about the combat system at all, it's just a two-button horror) There are also huge pixels, because of them, for example, you can't read some of the graffiti on the walls. By the way, there are no graphics settings in the game, only sound ones. The gameplay here is also so-so, I didn't fully understand whether this is a quest, or an arcade, or a platformer? The plot is generally delusional, everything will fit in a couple of lines, but there are 3 endings, 2 of which are the same) And to all this I want to add that the game can be completed in an hour and a half! I did not notice any advantages in the game at all. In the end, I want to warn everyone against buying this misunderstanding at full price, if you take it only with a big discount!) ",False,False

"Please do not get confused by all the fanboy reviews. I am not sure why so many people are giving this game a good rating, when it is literally unplayable. The game wont run in 4K. When the resolution is set to 4K, its completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up. I can only see 1/4 of the screen on my 4K monitor, and 1/4 on my second 1080p monitor, which means i cant even see the menu. Whenever i open the game now i defaults into 4K, which is broken, so i cant interact with anything in the menu. Update: Was finally able to actually get into the game. Below i will list just a few of the bugs that make this game absolutely unplayable.  - No matter what server you join, you will be disconnected after 5 minutes of play.   - Every time, you have to create a new character.  - In the character creation screen i made my character muscular, and when i spawned in game, he was fat.   - At 1440p on High settings, i get 40 FPS tops, with a GTX 1080. Very poor optimization.   - There are tabs in the server browser called ""Favorites"", ""Recently played"" etc. The servers you recently played on doesnt show up in the ""Recently played"" tab, and there is no obvious way to add a server to favorites, so the ""Favorites"" tab is useless as well.

There's nothing new, (Yes they added a new mode (cool)), but it's just a reskin of the past series. Personally, I think that the CoD MP became ♥♥♥♥, not to mention the Quickscopers and everycorner campers (this is another story), I do not remember when I last time enjoyed the CoD MP, maybe it's not for me anymore. I think that some fanboy's will not agree with me but it's their right, their decision, they enjoy multiplayer and let it be!

"Let me preface this review by saying I love this game, it has huge potential and it's an improvement on Theme Hospital which is an achievement in of itself, but unfortunately it's currently rife with problems that need fixing as they break the game. I'll happily give a thumbs up as soon as these things are fixed: EDIT: To fix the below issues do the following; Build no; Hand Sanitisers, Plants, Vending Machines, Leaflet distributors, Vendors of any kind, Benches, Ignore Queues of 8 or less (Do not build more GPS), No coffee machines in ANY room but staff room, Do NOT let patients use any toilets. Basically make your hospital completly bland and devoid of anything that makes staff/patients interact with anything other than the rooms. Max out nurses on Wards even if theres more of them than beds, it will counteract the terrible ward AI. It seems a bit ridiculous, but it's the only way to play right now with the AI being written so poorly. And now the list of broken things, which seem to on hindsight be mainly due to pathing / decision issues in the AI. Income Bugged; Income exceeds outcome and game states a profit but lose money every month.  Debt Bugged:  It seems to be that somtimes if you enter Red, even just a little, at the end of the month  instead of the game taking into account income and expenses, it ONLY uses expenses to calculate what your money total is, leading into impossible to get out of downward spirals where instead of losing the for example 20k difference after income you instead lose the entire 90k of expenses with income not used in the calculation at all] GP Offices bugged; Patients don't seem to interact with the offices properly, the queues seem to get longer, so you build more and the queues keep growing. Wards bugged: Stuck patients, nurses don't do anything 75% of the time, instead just walking around whilst the patients wait, hotfix didn't seem to fix this. Training bugged: The game bugs you to train staff constantly, so I did, what happens when you train them with cure increasing traits? The cure rate plumets, dramatically. I was at 80% cure rate with 0 rank doctors and nurses, I train them up to Treatment 1 & 2, cure rate plummets to 30%. Toilets bugged: Toilets in every building? Why bother, the patients often won't use them despite complaining they need the bathroom, I guess 12 stalls per building isn't enough, despite half of them being free of occupents. Drinks/Food bugged: What's that? You built every type of food or drink you can in every building and lowered the prices? Doesn't matter, patients randomly won't use them anyway and then leave because they're hungry and thirsty. Entertainment bugged: Don't bother offering Newsagents, giftshops, Arcade machines or Leaflet stands, they don't get used half the time anyway, patients will then leave because of this. Reception possibly bugged?: Nice big reception? Fully staffed with more than enough staff to rotate, enjoy people just standing infront of the desk unobstructed. Janitors bugged?: Enjoy plants not getting watered, bins not emptied, ghosts not being caught despite having 10 janitors you trained to all have ghost catching. Because it seems 50% of the time they just don't bother doing their jobs. This game is wonderful, but it seems like the longer a hospital goes on for, the more you improve the rooms and the more you train staff it just seems to break, it doesnt matter what job management you do etc etc the staff just seem to stop doing their jobs and stand around. The game should be hard, and is in the right areas, but at the moment it seems like it's just broken. ",False,False

But to me it felt like someone had taken some of my worst fears  and created a game based on them.  This was incredibly depressing and much more dark than I thought. It's not relaxing, at first I liked taking care of the goats and garden, I didn't mind that it was slow (even if it is really, really, really slow), but after a while every minute started to feel like ages. After 2 hours I had lost all the will to do anything, all my goats and chickens had died despite all my efforts to prevent it and I spent the last days just sitting in the chair doing nothing and praying for the game to end. I couldn't bear it anymore, and maybe that was the point? Then the ending made me feel even worse.

"I found it difficult to suggest whether to recommend this game or not as I do have mixed feelings towards D4. Firstly the concept of the game shows real promise, a detective with the ability to dive into the past using momentos in search for his wife's killer and the same person who shot him in the head effectively erasing his memory. The QTE's were one of the enjoyable aspects of the game and interactions with the environment. The voice acting is good except for one or two characters in perticular a giant man in a medical suit and mask called Roland Walker whom speaks unnecessarily slow, so slow infact that I just have to skip his diaologue as it just frustrates me how long it takes for him to string a sentence together. The worse part I'd have to say though would be how abruptly season one ended, it consists of 3 episodes, the prologue, episode 1 and episode 2, the prologue was good and easily explained what was going on, episode 1 had some action scenes and got interesting then episode 2 consisted of walking down corridor to one end to the other solving 2 easy puzzles then ending when it started to get good. Personally I'd wait for the season two release before buying into season one. ****UPDATE 05.01.17**** So it seems season 2 of this game has been cancelled so therefore I'm changing my previous recommended review to a not recommended review. As I stated above in my previous review which was wrote almost over a year and a half ago (June 2015) this game showed real promise, the story and the characters were interesting, but what we've been left with is an unfinushed game, half a game if you will...  Personally I find it out of order that Hidetaka Suehiro would just turn around after a year and a half absence and say that he's retired from Access Games despite his health being perfectly fine, and leaving his work unfinised. Too many game developers take us (the consumers) for a ride and it's unacceptbale, it's also becomming a reoccurring thing as well. The only saving grace is if Access Games get the go ahead to develop a second season, but personally I think it's dead now and probably not worth Access Games time or money. Anyway I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you like undeveloped and unfinished games. 6/10 ",False,False

"This is just clicking on rails. The enemies are able to corner you and you have nowhere to go to avoid their attacks because they are blocking the only way there is. Furthermore it is clicking for everything, so at first you can't really control your character well, because well, you click to attack, then you click to move. Many times you just move even if you don't even want to and have your character move right into that poison or attack or enemy. Frustrating. Not even changing to WASD for movement changed that, since the character would continue moving after I stopped holding my movement button. Rage inducing. Not fun. ",False,False

I really wanted to play Homefront for a long time, but my hands did not reach, and here was a free distribution on which I was able to take it. I had high hopes for it, because the game was released in 2011, when there was still no crisis of games in this genre. And so I launch a funky introductory video, but then, like in the stupidest American action films, everything is so clichéd: - Silly speeches from the lips of the main characters; - The most banal plot, you, the very person who will save the United States, although in fact, you are a no-name whose history has not been disclosed at all. - Insanely boring shootouts, in Call of Duty, where it seemed boring to shoot, it is much more fun, the weapon feels like it differs only in the model, and the recoil itself, damage, etc. generally the same, that on the machine gun, that on the M4; - Disgusting AI, you sit or lie in cover and in an incomprehensible way they kill you from the back, where there is no one in a priori, which makes the shootings even longer and more boring; - Short and boring storyline; - All unexpected turns are foreseen in advance, because, again, the plot is clichéd and banal. - Cinematicity of some moments; - The atmosphere of what is happening ",False,False

"Simple, but not losing its charm, indie game. This is a text-based game with RPG elements (although there is a minimum of leveling and using skills in the game, but out of habit you still train them :)) with its own pros and cons. I can't recommend it to fans of role-playing games - only if for informational purposes or from a feeling of despair due to the next postponement of the release of new suitable RPGs.

ICY is a world in which, after a catastrophe, firearms are lying around at every step, and hand-to-hand combat and edged weapons are ""neighing cleanly."" ICY is a world where a squad armed with firearms can easily be torn apart by wolves, lynxes and mutants. ICY is when a squad's inventory does not depend in any way on its number.

"I wish I did not buy that game.  Coming from 7 days to die, a good firend of mine 'forced' me to buy this game, because it's a zombie survival game which looks good and plays well or what ever the reason was .  And yes indeed it looks pretty well and it plays well (in regarts of graphic performance, smoothness). Funny - it is better in all aspects in which 7dtd isn't. And that are those aspects: good looks and performance - in which 7dtd is throughout AWFUL (really in 2018 you get eye cancer from that game).  I really did not play a lot as you can see, but pretty much everything annoyed me in such a way - it makes me angry as hell.  Carrying limitations, fighting with zombies, looting and crafting - all those things that are fundamental are boring. Like the only thing that made fun was shooting at zombies with guns - that was really cool though, but anything else was just 'meh'.  It might be a game where you have to put in like 30+ hours so that it starts to make fun.  But I just wanted to go into a server with a friend and have some fun.  First off, in 7dtd you can set markers and see the player list where you can befriend people so that they appear on the map and on the compass, which makes finding each other really easy. In M there is NOTHING. You have to friggin orientate thru the sun or what not.  7dtd greets you with a basic tutorial which is really satisfying.  In M you get NOTHING - once again.  So, after walking for like 20 minutes, we have met on a airport and a not so small military base with lots of tents and houses and even one pretty big house.  First of you cannot destroy sh* in this game. Like in 7dtd you literally can tear down a whole city - you can even do that with bare hands but that will take you like a week.  Than we did not know how to make a bedroll (which in 7dtd is your spawn point if you die) because it was not explained - and dont come up with ""you could have googled that"" - I might, but I might as well could have researched that what is due for my university work. I just wanted to get it, have some fun, enjoy a interesting world etc.  Crafting is alright, like in any other game, but harvesting is so unsatisfying - coming from 7dtd - and so is base building it takes long and it looks sh*t anyways.  But what was the most frustrating: looting. It was SO DAMN BORING. We were at that pretty big airfield, and there was nothing of worth. Then we got to the military basement, we got some weapons eventually (after like 3 hours) and literally only a handful of ammonition.  Fighting zombies with melee weapons is dog sh* - in 7dtd it is kinda edgy (like most thing are lol) but you can easily get out of a fight without being hit once.  In M I only one time managed to get out of a fight without being hit. Which is absolutely stupid and they even throw ROCKS at you like WTF? AND some of them even have blades as arms? Like what kind of apocalypse is this?  As I said shooting was fun and felt great - at least if you dont play with a shotgun because I hit a zombie like 3 times in the chest and I had to beat him with 3 melee hits to the ground afterwards.  So, we looted that area twice (because stuff 'respawned') which was really boring and disappointing + that really big building had nothing in it- NOTHING.  We tried to build up a car but like one part was not able to be found. Then my buddy got killed because he was low on health and zombies are running all the time and so he got caught and because I couldnt make it out of that shi*y building I could not save him - because apparantly you cannot shot thru windows in this game... Well he died, spawned who knows where, we got annoyed and yeah that was it.  I know I am kinda biased because I came from 7dtd. But I expected this game to be more action loaded (like a fast paced zombie game) and be more for a quick fun and optionally if you like you can build a base.  But what this game really lacks the most, is CHARACTER.  Oh boi, oh boi, what 7dtd has character, oh damn. It makes you laugh, scream, make absurd plans and traps has   tons of interesting moments - all those different zombies, how they look, the hunting, the building, the screamers if you put on like 3 forges - all that make up really interesting and fun moments.  M doesn't have any of that - it is so genetic. It almost looks like a DayZ rip off and PUBG (even tho M is much older then PUBG) - but it doesnt feel like one of these games. Maybe it should get more from those games.  I dont know. If it should ever come to a beta - which I hardly  believe as well as in any other zombie survival early access game (7dtd as well) - I might try it out another time.  As of current state I cannot recommend this game AT ALL. ",False,True

For example, I was offered to sell a card for 50 rubles, while it cost 200. ",False,False
Of all the HOGs I've played this game has the most unlikeable heroine. A man tells her to get off of his property and adds that it's not safe for her to be there? => She calls him crazy and sneaks inside. A house with you and another person inside is on fire? => She gets out immediately. The other person doesn't matter. A seemingly abandoned building is on fire? => She wants to extinguish the fire. ,False,False

"RAID has an identity problem. In that it has absolutely no identity to speak of.  The game feels like a quick mash together of random assets and already backlogged payday 2 assets despite the supposed dev time. You'd think with so many things being reused that there would be something to make up for it, more maps, more guns, more music, more skills, more stability, better performance, ANYTHING! However, this is sadly not the case. As of this very moment I've crashed a grand total of 19 times in the short time this game has been live. For something that's reusing SO much from another game I already own, this is quite honestly pathetic. This game has almost ALL the same issues that payday 2 had about two years ago. Desync is horrible, the AI is suicidal, the enemies will walk straight through walls while shooting players, they will SHOOT through walls even for the host of the game. Some of the missions are so bugged that trying to play them will result in SOMEONE in your group crashing without receiving any rewards whatsoever. I get that it has not been out long and I 100% get that they need time to fix it and that this is stressful for them, but as a consumer I have to plant my foot down, point to this broken ♥♥♥♥♥ and ask "" What the ♥♥♥♥ is this!? "".   This isn't a game it's a proof of concept. If anything this has severely shaken my trust in this developer.  The gun play is great fun, enemies drop when you're accurate and that's a wonderful change to payday 2 where the only thing that matters is whether you have overkill, silent killer, or berserker builds. It's based around the player's ability to aim and that's great. The only issue is that there's a period of NOTHING being unlocked between levels 13 or so....and level 28.....guys seriously!? What the hell were you DOING for two years!? There's nothing in this game that makes it unique, literally nothing, zero, zilch, nada, Cero, NOTHING! How can you have the gall to ask people to pay $40 for a game that has nothing in it? This game in its current state is debatably worth at most around $20 - $25. This is an early access product with none of the forewarning. I hope they turn things around but they've already killed their first impressions for their playerbase so they'll be hard pressed to pull people back in. I cannot and will not recommend this game, at least not in its current state. It's in shambles. ",False,False
"This DLC is way over hyped. It has a great environment, cool new enemies and a lot of cool vehicles. The problem is there isn't any fast travel with the majority of the map being connected by long highway type areas. This is not fun, you're forced to drive back and forth many times throughout the same areas over and over. You get the loot at the end but not really worth it IMO unless you plan on grinding out every play through. Its well done besides that but still takes about 5 hours to beat with a good 2 hours of driving (not exaggeration). ",False,False

"Another short, yuri, visual based Dharker title. Very short story that ends abruptly and never really goes much of anywhere from the 3 endings I've seen so far (they only wear the space suits in the thumbnail once and you could go the whole story without really realizing they're in space despite the title). The main focus of the novel is the cg's, which you need to go through way too many endings for and even buy additional $20 of dlc just for some extra scenes. Not worth the cash unless you have money to burn for a few nice images and animation to the extent of girls blinking occasionally. I will update once I've gone through all ~14 endings however.

"Don't even bother.. Seriously this game is just trash as ♥♥♥♥. The entire playstyle and mechanics are just so wierd and not precise when it comes to shooting, stealing, dunking etc. When you are defending and want to steal the ball, it's impossible, you've got 10% of stealing and 90% of pulling a foul. Its broken. I've got two OVR98 players with almost everything A+ and they still cant steal the ball from a OVR68 player, even if they are double teaming right in front of the basket. The shooting mechanics are completely trash as always. You need to not be guarded to get a big chance of scoring a 3 or 2pt. When it comes to myCARRER, its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ exhausting and boring as ♥♥♥♥. If you do not have any credits to use on your skills then theres no point in playing the gamemode. Basicaally this game is pay to win. If you however want to play on your team mode with is playing DJ as a nba superstar and earning 500credits after every game. Just do it to buy packs on myTEAM in order to get good players and play online not against CPU or bot. Basically because its broken mechanis and not presice when it comes to real experience. I get it that it's a bot that is playing the other team but what bothers me the most is that when you are leading, the bot is just impossible to stop, it scores 3pts every try and impossible to defend. When NBA 2k19 comes out please do not pre-order. watch youtube reviews and consider from there. Or wait til it's on sale if you are a despreate nba fan. DO NOT BUY IT ",False,False
"The Main character sucks: In Bethesda games you are a vessel. You are playing the very definition of a role playing game in this world. In Fallout 4 the main character has an established past and to an extent a personality. During dialogue you can choose options that were unclear when selecting, it also happens that you want to say something, and the character misses the mood you wanted it to be said in. Also the motivation is bad.  In Oblivion and Morrowind it's some prophecy stuff no one cares about, in skyrim it's that dragon no one cares about, in Fallout 3 it's your Dad, which you can just ignore, think that he's an ass anyway, and in Fallout New Vegas it's revenge and you as the Player can persue it, or just do whatever you want. No force in the world could stop a parent looking for their missing baby... or something. Also the character goes with just about everything anyone says. The dialogue system sucks: Every other Bethesda game could just write all the ♥♥♥♥ they wanted into the dialogue, because they didn't have to record every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice line twice. In Fallout 3 and New Vegas the player didn't even have any voice, only the NPC's. Also, with that stupid ""sarcastic"" option you can clearly see that they always HAD to be 4. It never could be only 2. In all other games, even when the choise often didn't matter all that much either, at least there were a few options. In Fallout 4 you can choose between: Yes, Yes, Yes or could you repeat the question.  Also skills don't imapct the dialogue, exept for speech. In previous Fallouts you can get different dialogue option if you had high inteligence or perception, or certain skills. In Fallout 4 that doesn't happen at all. Thare are rarly option that lead to a fight, or to a different result for a quest. It's no problem in a narratively driven game like Deus Ex, but in an open world playground it feels like they had to dumb it down for the casual players.  The leveling sucks: In Fallout 3 and New Vegas you had to choose your SPECIAL wisely, because they were, with exeptions, fixed. When leveling up you get points for certain abilities, and every 2 levels you could choose a special perk. In Fallout 4 everything is meaningless, because everything is the same, you can just pump points into what ever you feel like... exept, you can't. In 3 and New Vegas you could focus your Character to whatever Build you'd like to play with. If you want level 100 lockpicking, you can do that in about 3-4 levels, depending on your SPECIAL. In 4 that takes about 18 level because you can't build a decent character. The game FORCES you into an all over the place, confusing, dismantled character mess. Most things also don't have any special use in dialogue or on context. Even less so in dialogue. In 3 and New Vegas you didn't just get special dialogue options for Perks and Points, but also if you have a certain SPECIAL. Also the perks have often more context abilities. The SPECIAL due to their semi permanancy had a WAY bigger impact from the beginning. The points had more impact becasue you could build the character fast and however you want and the perks were actually usefull abilites to have. In Fallout 4 Leveling is nothing i was exited about, it's just part of the monotony. The world sucks: In Fallout 4 you can find something in almost every location. A skill book, a bobblehead, a legendary enemy or something. It sounds good in theory to find something in every corner, but longterm it's ♥♥♥♥. If it's almost everywhere it's nothing speical when you find it, it's part of a boring grind. In the other Bethesda games you often get into a cave or dungeon and don't find something great. But when you find something good it also feels good. Also skillbooks and bobbleheads are way less usefull then before.  Also you start the game in the top left corner. You can only move in one direction. Either the devs think you're too stupid the find the right way or... well actually, that's the only explanation i have. Another big problem is that ♥♥♥♥ is respawning. No other Bethesda game does this. And it's stupid. It also respawns all the resources you collect. And enemies still drop their loot. Instad of exploring the world for resources you can just farm whatever you need from weak starting enemies where you also already know where the good stuff is.  Crafting sucks: I didn't ever use the City builder thing while i've palyed, but i used the weapon and armor upgrades. The Armor first. I just farmed respawing enemies for leather and glue and screws where they respawn. Beacuse why would i incentivice player to explore the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ world in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bethesda game. Same stuff for Weapons. If you put points in Weapon upgrade early you can get some way too overpowered weapons too early. But hey, at least that makes the random legendaries useless. I was a little exited for my first 2 drops, but they only drop random stuff you probably already have, and almost always weaker then upgraded stuff you have of the same weapons. Just for an insigificant little ""extra"". Same with armor. There are the unique weapons like the item launcher thing or the cryo thing, but they are useless because they aren't weapons. They are gimmicks. Funnily enaugh, the way inferior system in Fallout 3 and New Vegas were better, because you were happy when you find one, even if it's not even one you'd like to use. They had more uniqueness because they were stronger, or different versions, they also were unique but actually useful. The progression sucks: After you get out of the Valut and get into it the game throws Dogmeat at you. In Fallout 3 it's likely that you never even see him, becuse he is at some scrapyard somehwere, and even then you have to explore it to find him. In New Vegas you get Rex after a few quests for the kings already in Vegas. Generally compaions where never that big of a thing previously. In New Vegas the first really obvious companion is Veronica and in Fallout 3 it's the Robot vendor near to the Tenpenny Tower or the Supermutant after Raven Rock. You can of corse look for some, or hire some, but ustualy you HAVE to look for them. In 4 they just get thrown at you at every opportuity. Next up, the FIRST real quest. You help the Minuteman. You get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Power Armor. In Fallout 3 you get it after about half of the game, and only if you ask the elder guy in the Pentagon. In New Vegas you even don't necessarily HAVE to get it. You either have to know where the hidden Valley is, or have to have a Quest that leads you there. Also you have to do quests for the Brotherhood before. Also you have the Deathcalw Bossfight here too. Again... in Fallout 3 that was after a few quests and exploring, and after a nice scipted sequence along with the Brotherhood of Steel. But you could also ignore it, come here later and the Brotherhood is gone, you have to fight the Behemoth on your own. And you get the Base build stuff right away too. After you rescued them you immediatly get the base build options. In all other Bethesda games if you want to do anything you have to have a certain level with a certain faction. In Oblivion you had the be a higher up in the Wizzar tower before you could make your own spells for example. Here you get EVERYTHING the game has to offer as soon as possible. In the previous game it was also possible to skip parts of the Story. In 3 you can just go to GRN if you know where it is. You can skip the quest with Speach. You also can just go to Riven City, ask for your Dad and that woman can just tell you that he's off in some Vault playing Video games. You ALSO can just go the that Vault and get him out, if you know where to go, skiping about 1/3 of the story, if not more. In New Vegas you can just go to Vegas without talking to the Rangers, Caesars Legion, Prim, or whoever. You can just go wherever you want until you meet Mr. House.",False,False

"The content of Dharma DLC is not as bad as its 65% bad review rate shows, but it is definitely not worth 70rmb, unless you are the third brother. Let’s evaluate its content first. Expansion restriction: This is currently the most controversial part for domestic players. Personally, I am more biased towards historical facts, and I am not very interested in the ball-long-flow gameplay. But I still feel dissatisfied with this new expansion restriction system. First of all, non-provincial provinces cannot preach. This is recognized as the worst design in this DLC. At the same time, it offends the ball leader and historical players. It has been determined that it will be removed from the new version and changed to non-provincial missionary power-2. This is still More to the appetite. The second is corruption. Excessive non-direct jurisdiction will automatically increase corruption. This is a setting closer to history, but what is the significance? Take my personal experience as an example. The Great Horde has already achieved the achievements of the Great Khan’s return (unification of Russia, Persia and China). The current ratio of directly-administered and non-directly-administered provinces is about 50/100. At this time, if I get full and eliminate corruption, the annual corruption will still decrease (about -0.4), and full corruption will cost me more than 200 oceans a month. More than 200! My monthly net income dropped from 1100 to 900! ——Are there any eggs? When you hit the stage where you need to fill the bar to eliminate corruption, the monthly income fluctuation of a few hundred yuan is meaningless. It just makes the player need to do one more operation. It is quite common for the government to operate inefficiently due to expansion, but the new design of P Agency is too simple and tasteless. India step up: This can be regarded as the usual way of licking the dog P club. Every time a DLC is released, the DLC protagonist will be licked to the sky. This is not incomprehensible, but the licking method of P Club is really blunt and boring. I support the practice of redoing the task tree and adding special systems, because it can increase the gameplay and highlight the historical characteristics of different regions. But is it really necessary to subdivide India into nearly 300 plots? For non-Indian forces, when they can touch India in the later period, the countries on it can still be eaten, and adding land just makes the whole process unnecessarily cumbersome. The international status of several elites such as Bangladesh, Bahmanni, and Delhi has not improved in any way. How to die or how to die. In the final analysis, P company is just frantically adding garbage plots (plots with poor terrain, output, and regional characteristics). For example, the surrounding area of ​​Diwu, which used to be several middle-class provinces, now has more than 10 garbage provinces. Not only does the soup and the medicine are changed, the medicine itself is even more unpalatable. Although the total number of points in the Sange area has increased, it will not bring any fundamental changes unless you choose Indian power. From my observation, whether in China (post it) or abroad (P Club, twitch), people who play in the third brother countries are in the minority, and there may not even be many people who play in Arab countries. As for the soaring Mughal, I don't want to say more. For the first time, I saw the reduction of technology, concept, nucleation, and stability. Establishing a Mughal is equivalent to buying a Europa Universalis VIP experience card, and everything you buy is discounted. Trade and colonization: Generally speaking, this part seems to be quite lawful. It gives players more ways to run trading companies and manage the trade center. The revision of the trade center also gives players more options when expanding, which should be liked. However, the ability of big countries to directly buy provinces from India is really incredible. If you want to restore the expansion history of trading companies, P company can completely change this to spend money to buy a percentage of the province’s trade power and province’s product output. It’s best. It is to be a colony, semi-colonial system. Buying provinces directly is really simple and rude. National Policy and Reform: The new policy system is equivalent to adding 3 free buffs for players. The new reform system is the least controversial and most acclaimed. It allows players to DIY different regimes by themselves, greatly increasing the gameplay of the regime system. However, at present, the characteristics of different political systems and the acquisition and loss of reform points are still very simple. I hope that society will be improved in the future. Looking back, this DLC's limitation on expansion is only meaningful for ball length, and only meaningful for those ball lengths in the strictest sense. Because of the existence of rubbish land in Siberia, Russia might have lay guns. Fortunately, P agency gave it a +20 buff in the revolutionary era, which perfectly avoided all this. As for other changes, you may be dazzled by the introduction on the store page, but believe me, you only need 5 minutes to understand them all after entering the game. Although the gameplay has been changed, it still lacks depth. The dlc is priced at 70 in the national area and 16 dollars for the foreign server. It can only be said that it deserves it.

"Where to start with this one? Well, umm... It's a shooter and that's about it. It's not even a particularly good one , truth be told.  The story is bland and un-original , basically : ""We need to stop the bad guys from them acquiring nuclear warheads. Oh, we need to shoot the bad guys! Oh, we got betrayed! Oh, we magically have new friends (Because plot convenience!). Oh, we shoot the big bad guy and save the day! Hurray!"".  And that's the game it a nutshell. Towards the game mechanics: 1. The game teaches you barely anything. Par example, it never mentioned that ""Q"" is to use the medkit, ""E"" to use the knife, or that the small grey bar situated at the middle foreground, was to show you if enemies could see you or not. (I figured that out in the last mission) 2. If you're using any gun other than a sniper rifle or the silence pistol, have fun with aiming at the Moon for most of the time due to the absurd level of recoil and no semi-auto setting. 3. If you're spotted by the enemy, prepare to load from the last checkpoint as all of the enemy soldiers have superhuman abilities and can shoot you down from 200m with an assault rifle. 4. Invisible walls, invisible walls f*cking everywhere you go. Thus to sum it up: Don't waste your money on this game. Yet if you do plan on buying it ,I highly recommend you do so when it's on sale.
