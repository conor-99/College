A relational database is made up of two parts: the structure of the tables and their columns and the data that is stored in these columns. The data manipulation language allows us to affect the latter. It allows us to select data from a table, insert rows into a table, update existing values in a table and delete rows from a table. Due to relational closure it is possible to nest several of these operations in a single query.

Rows of data can be inserted into a table using the insert statement. The columns to insert values for can be specified with a column list. The default value for a column will be inserted into applicable columns that are not included in the columns list - this is usually null. An error is returned if an attempt is made to insert a null value into a column assigned a 'not null' status. Multiple rows can be added to a table in the same insert statement. Results from a 'select' statement can be inserted into a table. The insert command can also be used in the 'insert into' form to add multiple rows to a table.

Individual values in a table can be updated using the update statement. An update command can contain a 'select' statement which allows multiple rows to be update in the same query. A 'searched update' can update multiple rows and a 'positional update' always updates a single row.

Rows can be deleted from a table using the 'delete' statement. A delete command can contain a 'select' statement. Joins can not be used in a delete command but sub-queries can. A 'searched delete' can delete multiple rows and a 'positional delete' always deletes a single row. Individual values can be 'deleted' by setting them to null.
