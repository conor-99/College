Tables are created using the 'create table' statement. Tables consists of columns which each have a name, type, size and optional integrity constraints. Table names must be system wide unique which can cause problems on large systems with many users and applications. The name of the creator can be concatenated with the table name to create a unique qualified table name which helps solve this issue.

Table definitions include their relationships to other tables in the database as well as restrictions on the data the can be entered. Constraints can be seen as the control the database has over data added to its tables. Every table will include a primary key constraint which enforces uniqueness over each row in the table via a particular column. A foreign key constraint forces the value of a column (or combination of columns) to match the value of a primary key in another table. A check constraint restricts the contents of a table. In the SQL2 standard it is specified as a search condition in the table definition. An assertion constraint restricts the contents of the database as a whole. It is also specified as a search condition but can restrict the contents of multiple tables and the relationships between them. An assertion can be created using the 'create assertion' statement. A domain definition constraint allows for further restrictions on the data that can appear in a column. It can be created using the 'create domain' statement. It is referenced as if it were a date type.

The format of a table can be modified using the 'alter table' statement. The 'drop table' statement can be used to remove tables from the database.
