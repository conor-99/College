Database applications using SQL can be written in three different way: direct invocation, embedded SQL and module language. In direct invocation SQL statements are directly invoked by the application. In embedded SQL statements are embedded directly in the programming language. In module language SQL statements are written separately in a module and called from the host program. This allows SQL to be included in more traditional programming languages. In static execution the exact text of the SQL statement is specified when the application is written. In dynamic execution some of the text in the SQL statement is determined during program execution. Every embedded SQL statement (with some minor exceptions) must be preceded by EXEC SQL. Embedded SQL statements may need to include a language-specific terminator. Every static embedded SQL application consists of declaratives and statements. Statements include declare cursor, whenever and fetch.
