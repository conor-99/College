This year instead of the end of semester exam you are required to write a paper on one of the following topics:

    Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)
    Post-Quantum Cryptography

Please note the following editorial guidelines:

    The paper should be tutorial in nature and should be written in a style comprehensible to readers outside the specialty of the article.

    The paper should be between 3000-4500 words (Introduction through Conclusions, excluding figures, tables and captions). Abstract, and References are also excluded from the word count.

    Figures and tables should be limited to a combined total of six.

    References should be included only to guide readers to more information on the topic; the reference list should not include every available source. A limit of 15 archival references is recommended, of which at least five should be academic conference or journal papers.

We will be assessing your report on the following (not all may apply in each case):

    Depth of Understanding of the Topic/Area of Research
    Security/Performance of the System
    Real World Applications
    Privacy Concerns
    Future Trends
    Quality of Writing, Grammar and Punctuation
    Quality of References

The submission is worth 80% of the marks for CSU34031. A single PDF of the manuscript should be submitted via Turnitin on Blackboard before 23:59 (UTC+1) on Monday the 11th of May. Please do not use material (text or diagrams) verbatim from any resources that you come across, as Turnitin will flag those and we will disregard that material when grading the paper.
