Select commands allow data to be retrieved from the database. They consist of two clauses: select and from. Data items including columns, constants and SQL expressions are specified in the select clause. The from clause consists of a list of table specifications. An asterix (*) can be used to select all of the columns from a table. If a query does not contain a tables primary key then their may be duplicate results. This can be avoided using the distinct keyword. The projection operator in relation algebra can be implemented using the select command. Clauses in a select statement must be in syntactical order (i.e. group by comes before order by). The optional clauses in a select command are where, group by, having and order by. Query results will always have the same row/column format as the actual tables in the database. Calculated columns can be included in the query. These columns can use arithmetic, time, date and string operators. The where clause can be used to only select rows matching a number of search conditions. These search conditions can include comparison tests, range tests, set membership tests, pattern matching tests and null value tests. Wild-cards can be used in pattern matching tests to create complex expressions. Boolean logic can be used to combine search conditions. Select commands can include aggregate functions which allows us to summarise the data retrieved. These functions are sum (computes the total value), avg (computes the average value), min (gets the minimum value), max (gets the max value) and count (gets the number of values). The additional functions, stddev and variance allow us to calculate the standard deviation and variance of the values, respectively.
